### Approach 1: Pig as a [qubit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit)

**Intuition**

These "strange" questions are now asked by Google, Baidu, and IBM because of their interest in quantum computing. [Quantum bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit) (or _qubit_) is the basic unit of quantum information, it's the quantum version of the classical binary bit. A binary bit has only two states: `0` and `1`, and on a very basic level, the qubit has more. In such questions, we deal with an object (here is a pig) which has more than two states.

**How many states does a pig have**

If there is no time to test, i.e. `minutesToTest / minutesToDie = 0`, the pig has only one state - `alive`.

If `minutesToTest / minutesToDie = 1` then the pig has time to die from the poison, that means that now there are two states available for the pig: `alive` or `dead`.

One more step. If `minutesToTest / minutesToDie = 2` then there are three available states for the pig: `alive` / `dead after the first test` / `dead after the second test`.

> The number of available states for the pig is `states = minutesToTest / minutesToDie + 1`.

**How many buckets could test `x` pigs with 2 available states**

One pig could test 2 buckets - let's make him drink from bucket number `1` and then wait `minutesToDie` time. If he is alive - the poison is in the bucket number `2`. If he is dead - the poison is in the bucket number `1`.

In the same way, two pigs could test $$2^2 = 4$$ buckets

> Hence if one pig has two available states, `x` pigs could test $$2^x$$ buckets.

**How many buckets could test `x` pigs with `s` available states**

> After the discussion above, the answer is quite obvious: $$s^x$$ buckets.

Let's consider as an example one pig with 3 states, _i.e._ `s = minutesToTest / minutesToDie + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`, and show that he could test `3` buckets.

**Solution**

Hence the problem is to find `x` such that $$\textrm{states}^x \ge \textrm{buckets}$$, where `x` is a number of pigs, `states = minutesToTest / minutesToDie + 1` is a number of states available for each pig, and $$\textrm{buckets}$$ is the number of buckets.

[The solution is well known](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_function) : 
$$x \ge \log_{\textrm{states}}{\textrm{buckets}}$$

To simplify the code let's rewrite the equation with the help of [natural logarithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_logarithmic_identities#Changing_the_base) :

$$
x \ge \frac{\log \textrm{buckets}}{\log \textrm{states}}
$$

**Implementation**


Note: In Java, and in many programming languages, comparing floating-point numbers like double values for exact equality can be problematic due to the way these numbers are represented in binary format. For example, the expression `log125 / log5` involves the division of two floating-point numbers, and the result might not be exactly equal to the expected result of `3` due to rounding errors in the representation of the logarithmic values. Therefore, it's common to use a small tolerance value when comparing floating-point numbers and consider the values equal when they are very close to each other within this specified tolerance. In Java code, we can represent the value of this tolerance as `1e-10`.


```python
class Solution:
    def poorPigs(self, buckets: int, minutesToDie: int, minutesToTest: int) -> int:
        states = minutesToTest // minutesToDie + 1
        return math.ceil(math.log2(buckets) / math.log2(states))
```


**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(1)$$ 
  - It's a [constant-time solution](https://stackoverflow.com/a/7317571/7775414).
* Space complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(1)$$.
  - We only create the variable `states`.
