## General
Given a non-negative integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, the algorithm executes a two-pointer approach to shrink boundaries or maintain a sliding window. It utilizes a hash map (`dict`) to store element values and their indices/frequencies for $O(1)$ fast access, a double-ended queue (`deque`) to support dynamic $O(1)$ push and pop operations at both ends. Key operations include bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`) for fast bitmask state updates.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(N log V)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(N log V)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
