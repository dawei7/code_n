### Approach 1: Work Backwards

**Intuition**

Instead of multiplying by 2 or subtracting 1 from `startValue`, we could divide by 2 (when `target` is even) or add 1 to `target`.

The motivation for this is that it turns out we always greedily divide by 2:

* If say `target` is even, then if we perform 2 additions and one division, we could instead perform one division and one addition for less operations [$(target + 2) / 2$ vs $target / 2 + 1$].

* If say `target` is odd, then if we perform 3 additions and one division, we could instead perform 1 addition, 1 division, and 1 addition for less operations [$(target + 3) / 2$ vs $(target + 1) / 2 + 1$].

**Algorithm**

While `target` is larger than `startValue`, add 1 if it is odd, else divide by 2.  After, we need to do $startValue - target$ additions to reach `startValue`.

```python
class Solution:
    def brokenCalc(self, startValue: int, target: int) -> int:
        ans = 0
        while target > startValue:
            ans += 1
            if target % 2: target += 1
            else: target //= 2

        return ans + startValue - target
```

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $O(\log target)$.

* Space Complexity:  $O(1)$.
