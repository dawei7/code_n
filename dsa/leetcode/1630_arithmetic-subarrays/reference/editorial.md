### Approach 1: Sort and Check

**Intuition**

The first thing to notice is that any arithmetic sequence must be sorted. This is because each successive element differs by a constant amount, so the entire sequence must be monotone since the change is constant.

For a given subarray `arr`, how do we check if we can form an arithmetic sequence? The problem states that we are allowed to rearrange `arr`. Thus, we should start by sorting `arr`, since if we can form an arithmetic sequence, the sequence must be sorted.

Once we have sorted `arr`, we can simply iterate over each adjacent element and check if the differences are constant. We will initialize $diff = \text{arr}[1] - \text{arr}[0]$ as the difference between the first two elements.

We will then iterate over all other adjacent elements and check if their difference is equal to `diff`. If **any** difference is not equal to `diff`, then we cannot form an arithmetic sequence.

If all differences are equal to `diff`, then we can form an arithmetic sequence. This brings us to our solution. We will define a function `check(arr)` that takes a subarray `arr` and applies the above process to determine if it is an arithmetic sequence.

Then, we will iterate over all pairs $l[i], r[i]$ and form `arr` as the subarray of `nums` from $l[i]$ $r[i]$. Once we have `arr`, we will pass it into `check` to find the answer for the $i^{th}$ query.

**Algorithm**

1. Define `check(arr)`:
- Sort `arr`.
- Initialize $diff = \text{arr}[1] - \text{arr}[0]$.
- Iterate `i` over the indices of `arr`, starting from `2`:
- If $\text{arr}[i] - arr[i - 1] \neq diff$, return `false`.
- Return `true`.
2. Initialize the answer `ans`.
3. Iterate `i` over the indices of `l`:
- Create `arr` as the subarray of `nums` from indices $l[i]$ to $r[i]$.
- Add `check(arr)` to `ans`.
4. Return `ans`.

**Implementation**

```python
class Solution:
    def checkArithmeticSubarrays(self, nums: List[int], l: List[int], r: List[int]) -> List[bool]:
        def check(arr):
            arr.sort()
            diff = arr[1] - arr[0]

            for i in range(2, len(arr)):
                if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] != diff:
                    return False

            return True

        ans = []
        for i in range(len(l)):
            arr = nums[l[i] : r[i] + 1]
            ans.append(check(arr))

        return ans
```

**Complexity Analysis**

Given $n$ as the length of `nums` and $m$ as the length of `l` and `r`,

* Time complexity: $O(m \cdot n \cdot \log{}n)$

    There are $m$ queries. In the worst-case scenario, each query would have $r[i] - l[i]$ = $O(n)$, representing an array of size $O(n)$.

    Then, we would require $O(n)$ to create `arr`, $O(n \cdot \log{}n)$ to sort `arr`, and $O(n)$ to iterate over `arr`.

    Thus, in the worst-case scenario, each of the $m$ queries costs $O(n \cdot \log{}n)$.

* Space complexity: $O(n)$

    We create `arr`, which may use up to $O(n)$ space.

### Approach 2: No Sorting

**Intuition**

We can implement `check` more efficiently! While it is true that any arithmetic sequence is sorted, we don't need to exploit this fact to determine if `arr` is an arithmetic sequence.

Let's say `arr` has a length of `n`, and we have the maximum element in `arr` as `max` and the minimum element as `min`.

If `arr` were to form an arithmetic sequence, then the difference `diff` that defines the sequence must be equal to $\dfrac{\text{max} - \text{min}}{n - 1}$.

Why? Because `min` must be the first element of the sequence and `max` must be the final element of the sequence. Thus, if we started at `min` and iterated to `max`, we would require $n - 1$ iterations. On each iteration, our value would increase by `diff` (by definition).

Therefore, we increment by a total of $\text{diff} \cdot (n - 1)$. By starting at `min` and ending at `max`, we cover a total distance of $max - min$. Thus, we have $\text{diff} \cdot (n - 1) = \text{max} - \text{min}$, which we can rearrange as $\text{diff} = \dfrac{\text{max} - \text{min}}{n - 1}$.

If `diff` is not an integer, then we cannot have an arithmetic sequence. If it is, how do we verify if `arr` is an arithmetic sequence or not?

If `arr` is an arithmetic sequence, then $min + diff$ must be in `arr`. Similarly, $min + 2 * diff$ must be in `arr`. In fact, every value of $min + k * diff$ that is less than `max` must be in `arr`. We can check if all of these numbers are in `arr`, and if they are, then `arr` must be an arithmetic sequence. For efficient $O(1)$ checks, we will convert `arr` to a hash set.

We can then check if all necessary numbers exist with a while loop. We initialize $curr = min + diff$ as the first number to check. If `curr` is not in `arr`, we can immediately return `false`. Otherwise, we check the next number by incrementing `curr` by `diff`. We repeat this process until $curr = max$. If all the numbers are in the hash set, then we return `true`.

**Algorithm**

1. Define `check(arr)`:
- Iterate over `arr` to do the following:
- Find `minElement`, the minimum element in `arr`,
- Find `maxElement`, the maximum element in `arr`.
- Create `arrSet`, a hash set with all the elements of `arr`.
- Calculate $diff = (maxElement - minElement) / (\text{arr.length} - 1)$. If it is not an integer, return `false`.
- Initialize $curr = minElement + diff$.
- While `curr < maxElement`:
- If `curr` is not in `arrSet`, return `false`.
- Increment `curr` by `diff`.
2. Initialize the answer `ans`.
3. Iterate `i` over the indices of `l`:
- Create `arr` as the subarray of `nums` from indices $l[i]$ to $r[i]$.
- Add `check(arr)` to `ans`.
4. Return `ans`.

**Implementation**

```python
class Solution:
    def checkArithmeticSubarrays(self, nums: List[int], l: List[int], r: List[int]) -> List[bool]:
        def check(arr):
            min_element = min(arr)
            max_element = max(arr)

            if (max_element - min_element) % (len(arr) - 1) != 0:
                return False

            diff = (max_element - min_element) / (len(arr) - 1)

            arr_set = set(arr)
            curr = min_element + diff
            while curr < max_element:
                if curr not in arr_set:
                    return False

                curr += diff

            return True

        ans = []
        for i in range(len(l)):
            arr = nums[l[i] : r[i] + 1]
            ans.append(check(arr))

        return ans
```

**Complexity Analysis**

Given $n$ as the length of `nums` and $m$ as the length of `l` and `r`,

* Time complexity: $O(m \cdot n)$

    There are $m$ queries. In the worst-case scenario, each query would have $r[i] - l[i]$ = $O(n)$, representing an array of size $O(n)$.

    Then, we would require $O(n)$ to create `arr`, $O(n)$ to create `arrSet`, and $O(n)$ to verify if `arr` is an arithmetic sequence.

    Thus, in the worst-case scenario, each of the $m$ queries costs $O(n)$.

* Space complexity: $O(n)$

    We create `arr` and `arrSet`, which may use up to $O(n)$ space.
