## Solution

### Overview

You are given two arrays, `arr` and `target`. In one step, we can reverse any subarray of `arr`. We need to determine whether or not it is possible to turn `arr` into `target` by performing any number of steps.

---

### Approach 1: Sorting

### Intuition

We can consider simulating a sequence of reversals on `arr` to see if it can be turned into `target`. Consider the following reversal strategy:

First, we iterate through each element $\text{target}[i]$ from left to right. For each $\text{target}[i]$, we locate the same element in `arr`, if it exists. If it does not exist, we can immediately return false as it is not possible to do any number of reversals for `arr` to match `target`. If the element $\text{arr}[j]$ is found, but not in the same position as $\text{target}[i]$, (i.e. `j > i`), we repeatedly swap  $\text{arr}[j]$ with the element in front of it, `arr[j-1]`, until $j = i$. This effectively pushes $\text{arr}[j]$ forward to the same position as $\text{target}[i]$. Note that this swapping is equivalent to repeatedly reversing the subarray `arr[j-1:j]` in which j is decremented at each step.

This swapping strategy demonstrates that `arr` can be rearranged in any possible order. As long as `arr` contains the same elements as `target`, the ordering of `arr` does not matter because it can always be reordered into `target` using the swapping strategy mentioned above.

Thus, the problem boils down to whether or not `arr` and `target` contain the same elements. In order to determine this, we can sort both arrays. If the arrays have the same elements, then their sorted versions should be identical. If they don't have the same elements, then their sorted versions will have at least one differing value at some index `i`.

### Algorithm

1. Sort both the input arrays `arr` and `target` in ascending order.
2. Iterate through the elements of both sorted arrays simultaneously:
* Compare corresponding elements from `arr` and `target`.
* If any pair of elements differs, return `false` as the arrays cannot be made equal.
3. If all elements match after the iteration, return `true` indicating that the arrays can be made equal by rearranging the elements.

### Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def canBeEqual(self, target: List[int], arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        arr.sort()
        target.sort()
        for i in range(len(arr)):
            if arr[i] != target[i]:
                return False
        return True
```

### Complexity Analysis

Let $N$ be the size of arrays `target` and `arr`.

* Time Complexity: $O(N \cdot log N)$

    Sorting each array takes $O(N \cdot log N)$. Iterating through the two arrays to check for differences takes $O(N)$.
    Thus, the total time complexity is $O(N \cdot log N)$.

* Space Complexity: $O(\log N)$ or $O(N)$

    Some extra space is used when we sort an array of size $N$ in place. The space complexity of the sorting algorithm depends on the programming language.
- In Python, the sort method sorts a list using the Timsort algorithm which is a combination of Merge Sort and Insertion Sort and has a space complexity of $O(N)$
- In C++, the `sort()` function is implemented as a hybrid of Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and Insertion Sort, with a worst-case space complexity of $O( \log N )$
- In Java, `Arrays.sort()` is implemented using a variant of the Quick Sort algorithm which has a space complexity of $O( \log N)$

### Approach 2: Frequency Counting With 2 Dictionaries

### Intuition

Another way to determine whether or not `arr` and `target` have the same elements is to compare their frequency counts for each of their elements. We can use a dictionary for each array, where each key represents an element, and its value represents the number of occurrences of that element in the array.
If the dictionaries differ at any point, it means `arr` cannot be turned into `target` through any number of operations.

### Algorithm

1. Create a frequency map `arrFreq` to count the occurrences of each number in the array `arr`.
* Iterate through `arr` and for each number, update the frequency in `arrFreq`.
2. Create a frequency map `targetFreq` to count the occurrences of each number in the array `target`.
* Iterate through `target` and for each number, update the frequency in `targetFreq` similarly.
3. Compare the size of the key sets of `arrFreq` and `targetFreq`.
* If they differ in size, return `false`, indicating the arrays cannot be equal.
4. Iterate through the keys in `arrFreq`:
* For each key, check if the frequency in `targetFreq` matches the frequency in `arrFreq`.
* If any frequency does not match, return `false`.
5. If all checks are passed, return `true`, indicating the arrays can be made equal by reversing subarrays.

### Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def canBeEqual(self, target: List[int], arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        # Dictionary to maintain frequency count for arr
        arrFreq = {}
        for num in arr:
            if num not in arrFreq:
                arrFreq[num] = 1
            else:
                arrFreq[num] += 1

        # Dictionary to maintain frequency count for arr
        targetFreq = {}
        for num in target:
            if num not in targetFreq:
                targetFreq[num] = 1
            else:
                targetFreq[num] += 1

        # Number of distinct elements of the 2 arrays are not equal
        if len(arrFreq) != len(targetFreq):
            return False

        for key in arrFreq:
            # Frequency for num differs
            if arrFreq[key] != targetFreq.get(key, 0):
                return False

        return True
```

### Complexity Analysis

Let $N$ be the size of arrays `target` and `arr`.

* Time Complexity: $O(N)$

    Iterating through each array and updating their dictionaries takes $O(N)$ time. Iterating through one of the dictionary's keys and performing lookups will also take $O(N)$ time. Thus, the total time complexity is $O(N)$.

* Space Complexity: $O(N)$

    In the worst case, each array's dictionary will have `arr.length` keys, taking up $O(N)$ space. Thus, the total space complexity is $O(N)$.

 ### Approach 3: Frequency Counting With 1 Dictionary

### Intuition

In the previous approach, we check if there are any differences in the two arrays' frequencies by comparing their respective frequency dictionaries.

However, we can streamline this process using only one frequency dictionary for `arr`. By creating the frequency dictionary `arrFreq` for `arr`, we can iterate through the `target` and check if each element exists in `arrFreq`. If it does, we decrement its frequency value in `arrFreq`. If the dictionary is completely empty at the end of the iteration, it indicates that `target` and `arr` have matching elements.

### Algorithm

1. Create a frequency map `arrFreq` to count the occurrences of each number in the array `arr`.
* Iterate through `arr` and for each number, update the frequency in `arrFreq`.
2. Iterate through each number in the `target` array:
* Check if the number is present in `arrFreq`. If not, return `false` as the arrays cannot be made equal.
* Decrease the frequency of the number in `arrFreq` by 1.
* If the frequency of the number becomes 0, remove the number from `arrFreq` as there are no more occurrences needed.
2. After processing all numbers in `target`, check if `arrFreq` is empty.
* If it is empty, return `true`, indicating that the arrays can be made equal.
* If not, return `false`.

### Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def canBeEqual(self, target: List[int], arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        # Frequency count for arr
        arrFreq = {}
        for num in arr:
            arrFreq[num] = arrFreq.get(num, 0) + 1

        for num in target:
            # If num does not appear in target, then arrays are not equal
            if num not in arrFreq:
                return False

            # Decrement the frequency count for num and
            # remove key if the count goes to 0
            arrFreq[num] -= 1
            if arrFreq[num] == 0:
                del arrFreq[num]
        return len(arrFreq) == 0
```
