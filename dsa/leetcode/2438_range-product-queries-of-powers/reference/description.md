## Description

Given a positive integer `n`, there exists a **0-indexed** array called `powers`, composed of the **minimum** number of powers of `2` that sum to `n`. The array is sorted in **non-decreasing** order, and there is **only one** way to form the array.

You are also given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `queries`, where `queries[i] = [left_i, right_i]`. Each `queries[i]` represents a query where you have to find the product of all `powers[j]` with `left_i <= j <= right_i`.

Return* an array *`answers`*, equal in length to *`queries`*, where *`answers[i]`* is the answer to the *`i^th`* query*. Since the answer to the `i^th` query may be too large, each `answers[i]` should be returned **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.
