## Description

You are given an integer array `nums`, where `nums[i]` represents the points scored in the `i^th` game.

There are **exactly **two players. Initially, the first player is **active** and the second player is **inactive**.

The following rules apply **sequentially** for each game `i`:

<ul>
	<li>If `nums[i]` is odd, the active and inactive players swap roles.</li>
	<li>In every 6th game (that is, game indices `5, 11, 17, ...`), the active and inactive players swap roles.</li>
	<li>The active player plays the `i^th` game and gains `nums[i]` points.</li>
</ul>

Return the **score difference**, defined as the first player's **total** score **minus** the second player's **total** score.
