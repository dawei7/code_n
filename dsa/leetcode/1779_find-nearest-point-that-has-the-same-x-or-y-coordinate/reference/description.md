## Description

You are given two integers, `x` and `y`, which represent your current location on a Cartesian grid: `(x, y)`. You are also given an array `points` where each `points[i] = [a_i, b_i]` represents that a point exists at `(a_i, b_i)`. A point is **valid** if it shares the same x-coordinate or the same y-coordinate as your location.

Return *the index **(0-indexed)** of the **valid** point with the smallest **Manhattan distance** from your current location*. If there are multiple, return *the valid point with the **smallest** index*. If there are no valid points, return `-1`.

The **Manhattan distance** between two points `(x_1, y_1)` and `(x_2, y_2)` is `abs(x_1 - x_2) + abs(y_1 - y_2)`.
