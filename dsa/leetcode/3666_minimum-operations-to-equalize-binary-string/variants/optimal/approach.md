## General
Given a binary string `s`, and an integer `k`, the algorithm executes breadth-first search (BFS) level-order traversal using a queue. It utilizes a double-ended queue (`deque`) to support dynamic $O(1)$ push and pop operations at both ends. Edge case handling: applies modulo arithmetic to prevent integer overflow.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
