## General
Given A farmer has a **rectangular grid** of land with `m` rows and `n` columns that can be divided into unit cells. Each cell is either **fertile** (represented by a `1`) or **barren** (represented by a `0`). All cells out..., the algorithm executes a single-pass linear scan through input elements. It utilizes a dynamic programming memoization table to cache intermediate subproblem states. Key operations include bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`) for fast bitmask state updates.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(mn)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(n)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
