## Description

You are given a string `s` that contains digits `0-9`, addition symbols `'+'`, and multiplication symbols `'*'` **only**, representing a **valid** math expression of **single digit numbers** (e.g., `3+5*2`). This expression was given to `n` elementary school students. The students were instructed to get the answer of the expression by following this **order of operations**:

<ol>
	<li>Compute **multiplication**, reading from **left to right**; Then,</li>
	<li>Compute **addition**, reading from **left to right**.</li>
</ol>

You are given an integer array `answers` of length `n`, which are the submitted answers of the students in no particular order. You are asked to grade the `answers`, by following these **rules**:

<ul>
	<li>If an answer **equals** the correct answer of the expression, this student will be rewarded `5` points;</li>
	<li>Otherwise, if the answer **could be interpreted** as if the student applied the operators **in the wrong order** but had **correct arithmetic**, this student will be rewarded `2` points;</li>
	<li>Otherwise, this student will be rewarded `0` points.</li>
</ul>

Return *the sum of the points of the students*.
