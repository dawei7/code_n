## General
### Beginner-Friendly Intuition & Strategy
The core task in **The Score of Students Solving Math Expression** is to a string `s` that contains digits `0-9`, addition symbols `'+'`, and multiplication symbols `'*'` **only**, representing a **valid** math expression of **single digit numbers** (e.g., `3+5*2`). This expression was given to `n` elementary school students. The students were inst.... Instead of recalculating the exact same subproblems over and over again, this solution uses **Dynamic Programming**. We break the larger problem down into smaller overlapping subproblems, solve each subproblem once, and store its result in a memory table. When building the final answer, we simply look up previously calculated answers.

### Step-by-Step Execution Guide
**Step 1: Setup & Base Cases**  
We initialize an empty hash map (`dict`) to act as our fast memory bank, storing elements and their indices or frequencies.  
**Step 2: Core Processing & Traversal**  
1. Compare elements at `array[left]` and `array[right]`.  
2. Advance `left` or retreat `right` based on comparison rules.  
**Step 3: Completion & Return**  
Bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`) allow ultra-fast bitmask updates in $O(1)$ hardware instructions.  
When processing finishes, the algorithm outputs the final validated solution.

### Why This Handles Edge Cases Gracefully
- **Single Element / Border Cases:** Loop bounds handle single items and empty inputs naturally.


## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(M^3V^2+A)$ — Detailed Analysis: The time complexity corresponds directly to the total number of operations required by the step-by-step execution loop described above.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(M^2V)$ — Detailed Analysis: The space complexity reflects the auxiliary memory allocated for tracking structures, recursion stack depth, or hash maps during processing.
