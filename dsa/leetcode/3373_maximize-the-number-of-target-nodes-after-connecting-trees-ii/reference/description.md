## Description

There exist two **undirected **trees with `n` and `m` nodes, labeled from `[0, n - 1]` and `[0, m - 1]`, respectively.

You are given two 2D integer arrays `edges1` and `edges2` of lengths `n - 1` and `m - 1`, respectively, where `edges1[i] = [a_i, b_i]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `a_i` and `b_i` in the first tree and `edges2[i] = [u_i, v_i]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `u_i` and `v_i` in the second tree.

Node `u` is **target** to node `v` if the number of edges on the path from `u` to `v` is even. **Note** that a node is *always* **target** to itself.

Return an array of `n` integers `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the **maximum** possible number of nodes that are **target** to node `i` of the first tree if you had to connect one node from the first tree to another node in the second tree.

**Note** that queries are independent from each other. That is, for every query you will remove the added edge before proceeding to the next query.
