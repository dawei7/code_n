## Description

You are given a **positive** integer `hp` and two **positive** **1-indexed** integer arrays `damage` and `requirement`.

There is a dungeon with `n` trap rooms numbered from 1 to `n`. Entering room `i` reduces your health points by `damage[i]`. After that reduction, if your remaining health points are **at least** `requirement[i]`, you earn **1 point **for that room.

Let `score(j)` be the number of **points** you get if you start with `hp` health points and enter the rooms `j`, `j + 1`, ..., `n` in this order.

Return the integer `score(1) + score(2) + ... + score(n)`, the sum of scores over all starting rooms.

**Note**: You cannot skip rooms. You can finish your journey even if your health points become non-positive.
