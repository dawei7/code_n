## General
Given a string `word`. A letter `c` is called **special** if it appears **both** in lowercase and uppercase in `word`, and **every** lowercase occurrence of `c` appears before the **first** uppercase occurrence of `c`, the algorithm executes a single-pass linear scan through input elements. It utilizes a hash map (`dict`) to store element values and their indices/frequencies for $O(1)$ fast access.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
