## Description

In a town, there are `n` people labeled from `1` to `n`. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

If the town judge exists, then:

<ol>
	<li>The town judge trusts nobody.</li>
	<li>Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.</li>
	<li>There is exactly one person that satisfies properties **1** and **2**.</li>
</ol>

You are given an array `trust` where `trust[i] = [a_i, b_i]` representing that the person labeled `a_i` trusts the person labeled `b_i`. If a trust relationship does not exist in `trust` array, then such a trust relationship does not exist.

Return *the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return *`-1`* otherwise*.
