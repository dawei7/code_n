## General
**Optimal Approach — Check if Bitwise OR Has Trailing Zeros**

The solution employs Sequential iteration scanning input elements and dynamically updating state. Key implementation techniques include Bitwise manipulation (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`) for fast bitmask state updates.

**Why This Approach Was Chosen:**
Sourced from `doocs/leetcode` (or refined to expert standard) in method `hasTrailingZeros`. This implementation is chosen for its exceptional readability, idiomatic Python 3 constructs, and clear structural separation of concerns suitable for technical software engineering interviews.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(N)$ — Operation count proportional to input scale.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.

## Alternatives and edge cases
- **Clean Code Standards:** Uses descriptive variable names, standard Python 3 typing, and idiomatic control flow.
- **Robust Edge Case Management:** Handles boundary states (empty inputs, single elements, zero values) naturally through algorithm design without arbitrary conditional branching.
