## Description

You want to build `n` new buildings in a city. The new buildings will be built in a line and are labeled from `1` to `n`.

However, there are city restrictions on the heights of the new buildings:

<ul>
	<li>The height of each building must be a non-negative integer.</li>
	<li>The height of the first building **must** be `0`.</li>
	<li>The height difference between any two adjacent buildings **cannot exceed** `1`.</li>
</ul>

Additionally, there are city restrictions on the maximum height of specific buildings. These restrictions are given as a 2D integer array `restrictions` where `restrictions[i] = [id_i, maxHeight_i]` indicates that building `id_i` must have a height **less than or equal to** `maxHeight_i`.

It is guaranteed that each building will appear **at most once** in `restrictions`, and building `1` will **not** be in `restrictions`.

Return *the **maximum possible height** of the **tallest** building*.
