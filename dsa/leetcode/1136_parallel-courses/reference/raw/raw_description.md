## Description

You are given an integer `n`, which indicates that there are `n` courses labeled from `1` to `n`. You are also given an array `relations` where `relations[i] = [prevCourse_i, nextCourse_i]`, representing a prerequisite relationship between course `prevCourse_i` and course `nextCourse_i`: course `prevCourse_i` has to be taken before course `nextCourse_i`.

In one semester, you can take **any number** of courses as long as you have taken all the prerequisites in the **previous** semester for the courses you are taking.

Return *the **minimum** number of semesters needed to take all courses*. If there is no way to take all the courses, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

![](images/course1graph.jpg)

```
**Input:** n = 3, relations = [[1,3],[2,3]]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The figure above represents the given graph.
In the first semester, you can take courses 1 and 2.
In the second semester, you can take course 3.
```

**Example 2:**

![](images/course2graph.jpg)

```
**Input:** n = 3, relations = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** No course can be studied because they are prerequisites of each other.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n <= 5000`

	- `1 <= relations.length <= 5000`

	- `relations[i].length == 2`

	- `1 <= prevCourse_i, nextCourse_i <= n`

	- `prevCourse_i != nextCourse_i`

	- All the pairs `[prevCourse_i, nextCourse_i]` are **unique**.
