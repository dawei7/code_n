## Description

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, each of length `n`. You may perform the following **split-and-merge operation** on `nums1` any number of times:

<ol>
	<li>Choose a subarray `nums1[L..R]`.</li>
	<li>Remove that subarray, leaving the prefix `nums1[0..L-1]` (empty if `L = 0`) and the suffix `nums1[R+1..n-1]` (empty if `R = n - 1`).</li>
	<li>Re-insert the removed subarray (in its original order) at **any** position in the remaining array (i.e., between any two elements, at the very start, or at the very end).</li>
</ol>

Return the **minimum** number of **split-and-merge operations** needed to transform `nums1` into `nums2`.
