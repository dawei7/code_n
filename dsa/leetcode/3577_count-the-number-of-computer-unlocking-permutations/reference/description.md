### 1. Description

You are given an array `complexity` of length `n`.

There are `n` **locked** computers in a room with labels from 0 to $n - 1$, each with its own **unique** password. The password of the computer `i` has a complexity $\text{complexity}[i]$.

The password for the computer labeled 0 is **already** decrypted and serves as the root. All other computers must be unlocked using it or another previously unlocked computer, following this information:

- You can decrypt the password for the computer `i` using the password for computer `j`, where `j` is **any** integer less than `i` with a lower complexity. (i.e. `j < i` and $\text{complexity}[j] < \text{complexity}[i]$)

- To decrypt the password for computer `i`, you must have already unlocked a computer `j` such that `j < i` and $\text{complexity}[j] < \text{complexity}[i]$.

Find the number of permutations of `[0, 1, 2, ..., (n - 1)]` that represent a valid order in which the computers can be unlocked, starting from computer 0 as the only initially unlocked one.

Since the answer may be large, return it **modulo** $10^{9}$ + 7.

### 2. Function Contract

**Inputs**

- `complexity`: Input parameter (`List[int]`).

**Return value**

- Returns `int`.

### 3. Note

that the password for the computer **with label** 0 is decrypted, and *not* the computer with the first position in the permutation.

### 4. Examples

#### Example 1

- **Input:** complexity = [1,2,3]

- **Output:** 2

- **Explanation:** The valid permutations are:

- [0, 1, 2]

		- Unlock computer 0 first with root password.

- Unlock computer 1 with password of computer 0 since $\text{complexity}[0] < \text{complexity}[1]$.

- Unlock computer 2 with password of computer 1 since $\text{complexity}[1] < \text{complexity}[2]$.

- [0, 2, 1]

		- Unlock computer 0 first with root password.

- Unlock computer 2 with password of computer 0 since $\text{complexity}[0] < \text{complexity}[2]$.

- Unlock computer 1 with password of computer 0 since $\text{complexity}[0] < \text{complexity}[1]$.

#### Example 2

- **Input:** complexity = [3,3,3,4,4,4]

- **Output:** 0

- **Explanation:** There are no possible permutations which can unlock all computers.

### 5. Constraints

- $2 \le \text{complexity.length} \le 10^{5}$

- $1 \le \text{complexity}[i] \le 10^{9}$
