### Overview

This question asks you to implement the ***debounce*** higher-order function. After the debounced function is called, the provided function should be called with the same arguments but with some delay `t`. However, if the debounced function was called again before `t` milliseconds have elapsed, the execution of the provided function should be cancelled and the timer reset.

To give a concrete example of debounce in action:

```js
const start = Date.now();
function log() {
  console.log(Date.now() - start);
}

setTimeout(log, 10); // logs: 10
setTimeout(log, 20); // logs: 20
setTimeout(log, 50); // logs: 50
setTimeout(log, 60); // logs: 60
```

As expected, the `log` function is called with the delay specified by `setTimeout`.

However, if we debounce the `log` function:

```js
const start = Date.now();
function log() {
  console.log(Date.now() - start);
}
const debouncedLog = debounce(log, 20);

setTimeout(debouncedLog, 10); // cancelled
setTimeout(debouncedLog, 20); // logs: 40
setTimeout(debouncedLog, 50); // cancelled
setTimeout(debouncedLog, 60); // logs: 80
```

In the above example, the function call at `t=10ms` is cancelled because the call at `t=20ms` happened within 20ms. The call at `t=20ms` was delayed by 20ms.

Similarly, the function call at `t=50ms` is cancelled because the call at `t=60ms` happened within 20ms. The call at `t=60ms` was delayed by 20ms.

#### Use-cases for Debounce

The main use-case is when you don't want the result of some user interaction to effect the user experience.

A classic use-case of debounce is when the user is typing into a search field. If you were to show new results every single time a character was typed, the act of re-rendering the new filtered list could potentially take longer than the time it takes to type another character. This will result in a frustrating delay when the user is typing (something you have probably experienced).

Ideally, what should happen is the function that renders the filtered list is debounced. That way, it only renders AFTER the user is done typing.

Another example would be zooming out on a chart via pinch-and-zoom. More data will need to be downloaded once zoomed out. However, it would be extremely inefficient if a new request was made at 60 frames per second as the user zooms out. Just like in the typing example, you should only query for more data when the user is DONE zooming out.

```js
async function fetchNewData(startDate, endDate) {
  // Request Logic
}
const debouncedFetch = debounce(fetchNewData, 300);

chart.on('zoom', (startDate, endDate) => {
  debouncedFetch(startDate, endDate);
});
```

The library Lodash has a popular implementation of [debounce](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#debounce).

### Approach 1: setTimeout + clearTimeout

Every time the debounced function is called, we want to execute `fn` after some delay. We can use `setTimeout` to achieve that goal. But we also need to keep a reference to `timeout` that was returned. That way, we can cancel the execution of `fn` if the function was called again (via `clearTimeout`). It's important to note that calling `clearTimeout` on `undefined` or a finished timeout will do nothing.

```javascript
var debounce = function(fn, t) {
    let timeout;
    return function(...args) {
        clearTimeout(timeout);
        timeout = setTimeout(() => fn.apply(this, args), t)
    }
};
```

### Approach 2: setInterval + clearInterval

`setInterval` works similarly to `setTimeout`, but it will keep executing the callback indefinitely at some interval until `clearInterval` is called.

We emulate the behavior of `setTimeout` by giving the interval a very small value like `1ms`. Then we can check if the appropriate amount of time has elapsed by constantly checking if $\text{Date.now}() - lastCall \ge t$. Once that condition is met, we should call `fn` and stop the interval. We should also abort any existing interval every time the function is called to cancel the pending execution of `fn`.

Note that this solution is really for demonstration purposes only as it is very inefficient.

```javascript
var debounce = function(fn, t) {
  let interval;
  return function(...args) {
    const lastCall = Date.now()
    clearInterval(interval);
    interval = setInterval(() => {
      if (Date.now() - lastCall >= t) {
        fn(...args);
        clearInterval(interval);
      }
    }, 1);
  }
};
```
