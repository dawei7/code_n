## General
Given two integers, `n` and `k`, an **alternating permutation** is a permutation of the first `n` positive integers such that no **two** adjacent elements are both odd or both even, the algorithm executes a single-pass linear scan through input elements. Key operations include bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`) for fast bitmask state updates. Edge case handling: guards against empty/null inputs via early returns, applies modulo arithmetic to prevent integer overflow.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n^2)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(n)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
