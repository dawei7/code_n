## General
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return *the length of the shortest non-empty **subarray** of *`nums`* with a sum of at least *`k`. If there is no such **subarray**, return `-1`, the algorithm executes breadth-first search (BFS) level-order traversal using a queue. It utilizes a double-ended queue (`deque`) to support dynamic $O(1)$ push and pop operations at both ends.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(n)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
