### Approach: Sum Modulo

#### Intuition

The problem requires the sum of the elements and $\textit{sum}$ to be divisible by $k$. Since each operation can only decrease an element $x$ in the array by 1, which reduces the total sum by 1 each time, at least $\textit{sum} \bmod k$ reductions are needed to make the sum divisible by $k$. Therefore, the minimum number of operations required is $\textit{sum} \bmod k$.

#### Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        return sum(nums) % k
```

#### Complexity Analysis

Let $n$ be the length of $\textit{nums}$.

- Time complexity: $O(n)$.

  The algorithm traverses the array once.

- Space complexity: $O(1)$.
