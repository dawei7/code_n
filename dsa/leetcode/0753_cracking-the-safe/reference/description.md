## Description

There is a safe protected by a password. The password is a sequence of `n` digits where each digit can be in the range `[0, k - 1]`.

The safe has a peculiar way of checking the password. When you enter in a sequence, it checks the **most recent **`n`** digits** that were entered each time you type a digit.

<ul>
	<li>For example, the correct password is `"345"` and you enter in `"012345"`:

	<ul>
		<li>After typing `0`, the most recent `3` digits is `"0"`, which is incorrect.</li>
		<li>After typing `1`, the most recent `3` digits is `"01"`, which is incorrect.</li>
		<li>After typing `2`, the most recent `3` digits is `"012"`, which is incorrect.</li>
		<li>After typing `3`, the most recent `3` digits is `"123"`, which is incorrect.</li>
		<li>After typing `4`, the most recent `3` digits is `"234"`, which is incorrect.</li>
		<li>After typing `5`, the most recent `3` digits is `"345"`, which is correct and the safe unlocks.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

Return *any string of **minimum length** that will unlock the safe **at some point** of entering it*.
