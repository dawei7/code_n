## Description

You are given two strings `s` and `sub`. You are also given a 2D character array `mappings` where `mappings[i] = [old_i, new_i]` indicates that you may perform the following operation **any** number of times:

<ul>
	<li>**Replace** a character `old_i` of `sub` with `new_i`.</li>
</ul>

Each character in `sub` **cannot** be replaced more than once.

Return `true`* if it is possible to make *`sub`* a substring of *`s`* by replacing zero or more characters according to *`mappings`. Otherwise, return `false`.

A **substring** is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.
