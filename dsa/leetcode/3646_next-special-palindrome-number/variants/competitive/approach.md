## General
Given an integer `n`, the algorithm executes binary search over the search space to achieve logarithmic reduction. It utilizes a hash map (`dict`) to store element values and their indices/frequencies for $O(1)$ fast access. Key operations include bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`) for fast bitmask state updates. Edge case handling: guards against empty/null inputs via early returns, applies modulo arithmetic to prevent integer overflow.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(1)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
