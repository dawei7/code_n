## General
Given There is a `50 x 50` chessboard with **one** knight and some pawns on it. You are given two integers `kx` and `ky` where `(kx, ky)` denotes the position of the knight, and a 2D array `positions` where $\text{positions..., the algorithm executes breadth-first search (BFS) level-order traversal using a queue. It utilizes a hash map (`dict`) to store element values and their indices/frequencies for $O(1)$ fast access, a dynamic programming memoization table to cache intermediate subproblem states. Key operations include bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`) for fast bitmask state updates. Edge case handling: guards against empty/null inputs via early returns.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(p B + p^2 2^p)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(B + p 2^p)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
