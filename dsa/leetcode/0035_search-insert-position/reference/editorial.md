### Approach 1: Binary Search

**Intuition**

Based on the description of the problem, we can see that it could be a good match with the [binary search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm) algorithm.

> Binary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a _sorted_ array.

Usually, within binary search, we compare the target value to the middle element of the array at each iteration.

- If the target value is equal to the middle element, the job is done.

- If the target value is less than the middle element, continue to search on the left.

- If the target value is greater than the middle element, continue to search on the right.

Here we showcase a simple example of how it works.

To mark the search boundaries, one could use two pointers: `left` and `right`.

Starting from $left = 0$ and $right = n - 1$, we then move either of the pointers according to various situations:

- While $left \le right$:

- The pivot index is the one in the middle: $pivot = (left + right) / 2$. The pivot also divides the original array into two subarrays.

- If the target value is equal to the pivot element: $target = \text{nums}[pivot]$, we're done.

- If the target value is less than the pivot element $target < \text{nums}[pivot]$, continue to search on the left subarray by moving the right pointer $right = pivot - 1$.

- If the target value is greater than the pivot element $target > \text{nums}[pivot]$, continue to search on the right subarray by moving the left pointer $left = pivot + 1$.

> What if the target value is not found?

In this case, the loop will be stopped at the moment when `right < left` and $\text{nums}[right] < target < \text{nums}[left]$.

Hence, the proper position to insert the target is at the index `left`.

**Integer Overflow**

Let us now stress the fact that $pivot = (left + right) // 2$ works fine for Python3, which has arbitrary precision integers, but it could cause some issues in Java and C++.

If $left + right$ is greater than the maximum int value $2^{31} - 1$, it overflows to a negative value. In Java, it would trigger an exception of `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, and in C++ it causes an illegal write, which leads to memory corruption and unpredictable results.

Here is a simple way to fix it:

```python
pivot = (left + right) // 2
```

and here is a bit more complicated but probably faster way using the bit shift operator.

```python
pivot = (left + right) >> 1
```

**Algorithm**

- Initialize the `left` and `right` pointers: $left = 0$, $right = n - 1$.

- While $left \le right$:

- Compare middle element of the array $\text{nums}[pivot]$ to the target value `target`.

- If the middle element _is_ the target, _i.e._ $target = \text{nums}[pivot]$: return `pivot`.

- If the target is not here:

- If $target < \text{nums}[pivot]$, continue to search on the left subarray. $right = pivot - 1$.

- Else continue to search on the right subarray. $left = pivot + 1$.

- Return `left`.

        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while left <= right:
            pivot = (left + right) // 2
            if nums[pivot] == target:
                return pivot
            if target < nums[pivot]:
                right = pivot - 1
            else:
                left = pivot + 1
        return left
```

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$.

    Let us compute the time complexity with the help of [master theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_theorem_(analysis_of_algorithms))

    $T(N) = aT\left(\frac{N}{b}\right) + \Theta(N^d)$.

    The equation represents dividing the problem up into $a$ subproblems of size $\frac{N}{b}$ in $\Theta(N^d)$ time.

    Here at each step there is only one subproblem _i.e._ $a = 1$, its size is half of the initial problem _i.e._ $b = 2$, and all this happens in a constant time _i.e._ $d = 0$. As a result, $\log_b{a} = d$ and hence we're dealing with [case 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_theorem_(analysis_of_algorithms)#Case_2_example) that results in $\mathcal{O}(n^{\log_b{a}} \log^{d + 1} N)$ = $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ time complexity.

* Space complexity: $\mathcal{O}(1)$

    since it's a constant space solution.
