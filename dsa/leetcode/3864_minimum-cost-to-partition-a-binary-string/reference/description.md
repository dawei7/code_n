## Description

You are given a binary string `s` and two integers `encCost` and `flatCost`.

For each index `i`, `s[i] = '1'` indicates that the `i^th` element is sensitive, and `s[i] = '0'` indicates that it is not.

The string must be partitioned into **segments**. Initially, the entire string forms a single segment.

For a segment of length `L` containing `X` sensitive elements:

<ul>
	<li>If `X = 0`, the cost is `flatCost`.</li>
	<li>If `X > 0`, the cost is `L * X * encCost`.</li>
</ul>

If a segment has **even length**, you may split it into **two contiguous segments** of **equal** length and the cost of this split is the **sum** of **costs** of the resulting segments.

Return an integer denoting the **minimum possible total cost** over all valid partitions.
