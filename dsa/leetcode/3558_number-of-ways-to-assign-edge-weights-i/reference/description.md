## Description

There is an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled from 1 to `n`, rooted at node 1. The tree is represented by a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `u_i` and `v_i`.

Initially, all edges have a weight of 0. You must assign each edge a weight of either **1** or **2**.

The **cost** of a path between any two nodes `u` and `v` is the total weight of all edges in the path connecting them.

Select any one node `x` at the **maximum** depth. Return the number of ways to assign edge weights in the path from node 1 to `x` such that its total cost is **odd**.

Since the answer may be large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

**Note:** Ignore all edges **not** in the path from node 1 to `x`.
