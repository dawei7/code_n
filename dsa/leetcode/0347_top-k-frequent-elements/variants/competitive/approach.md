## General
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return *the* `k` *most frequent elements*. You may return the answer in **any order**, the algorithm executes a two-pointer approach to shrink boundaries or maintain a sliding window. It utilizes a hash map (`dict`) to store element values and their indices/frequencies for $O(1)$ fast access. Key operations include bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`) for fast bitmask state updates. Edge case handling: guards against empty/null inputs via early returns.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(n)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
