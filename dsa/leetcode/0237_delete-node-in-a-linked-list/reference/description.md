## Description

There is a singly-linked list `head` and we want to delete a node `node` in it.

You are given the node to be deleted `node`. You will **not be given access** to the first node of `head`.

All the values of the linked list are **unique**, and it is guaranteed that the given node `node` is not the last node in the linked list.

Delete the given node. Note that by deleting the node, we do not mean removing it from memory. We mean:

<ul>
	<li>The value of the given node should not exist in the linked list.</li>
	<li>The number of nodes in the linked list should decrease by one.</li>
	<li>All the values before `node` should be in the same order.</li>
	<li>All the values after `node` should be in the same order.</li>
</ul>

**Custom testing:**

<ul>
	<li>For the input, you should provide the entire linked list `head` and the node to be given `node`. `node` should not be the last node of the list and should be an actual node in the list.</li>
	<li>We will build the linked list and pass the node to your function.</li>
	<li>The output will be the entire list after calling your function.</li>
</ul>
