## General
Given a string `paragraph` and a string array of the banned words `banned`, return *the most frequent word that is not banned*. It is **guaranteed** there is **at least one word** that is not banned, and that the answer is ..., the algorithm executes a single-pass linear scan through input elements. It utilizes a hash map (`dict`) to store element values and their indices/frequencies for $O(1)$ fast access.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(p + b)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(u + b)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
