## Description

You have an infinite number of stacks arranged in a row and numbered (left to right) from `0`, each of the stacks has the same maximum capacity.

Implement the `DinnerPlates` class:

<ul>
	<li>`DinnerPlates(int capacity)` Initializes the object with the maximum capacity of the stacks `capacity`.</li>
	<li>`void push(int val)` Pushes the given integer `val` into the leftmost stack with a size less than `capacity`.</li>
	<li>`int pop()` Returns the value at the top of the rightmost non-empty stack and removes it from that stack, and returns `-1` if all the stacks are empty.</li>
	<li>`int popAtStack(int index)` Returns the value at the top of the stack with the given index `index` and removes it from that stack or returns `-1` if the stack with that given index is empty.</li>
</ul>
