### Overview

We are given two integer arrays that represent the `preorder` and `postorder` traversals of a binary tree. Our task is to rebuild the tree and return its root. First, let's clarify the key terms involved in this task:

A *binary tree* is a tree data structure where each node has at most two children, called `left` and `right`. Tree traversal means visiting all the nodes in a specific order. In this problem, we use two common types of binary tree traversal:

-   **Preorder traversal**: We visit the current node first, then go to the left child, and finally to the right child. This means that the parent node will appear before its children in the `preorder` array.

-   **Postorder traversal**: We temporarily ignore the current node and move directly to its children, visiting the left child first and then the right. After that, we return to the node and process it last. In other words, the parent node always appears after its children in the `postorder` array.

-   [Binary Tree Postorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-postorder-traversal/description/)

### Approach 1: Divide and Conquer

#### Intuition

Binary trees are inherently recursive structures, meaning we can break them down into smaller subtrees until the problem becomes simple enough to solve directly. In this problem, the base cases are straightforward: if the traversal arrays contain only one element, the tree consists of a single node with that element as its value. Even simpler, when the arrays are empty, the tree is `NULL`.

For cases where the arrays contain more than one element, we assume we already know how to solve the problem for smaller trees ($N - 1$ elements or fewer). The key observation is that the first node in the preorder traversal is always the root of the tree. Our goal, then, is to correctly determine which parts of the preorder and postorder arrays correspond to the left and right subtrees. Once we identify these sections, we can recursively construct the left and right subtrees and attach them to the root, forming the complete tree.

To determine which nodes belong to the left and right subtrees, note that the second element in the preorder array is the root of the left subtree, which we'll call `leftRoot`. In the `postorder` array, all nodes visited before `leftRoot` belong to the left subtree. Conversely, the nodes visited after `leftRoot` in the `postorder` array belong to the right subtree. Using this division, we can pass the appropriate segments of the arrays to the recursive function, allowing it to build the tree step by step.

This approach is based on the **Divide and Conquer** technique, where we recursively break the problem down into two or more subproblems of the same type, continuing until we reach a base case. For a deeper understanding of the topic, you can refer to the relevant [LeetCode Explore Card 🔗](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/divide-and-conquer/).

#### Algorithm

-   Define the recursive function `constructTree(preStart, preEnd, postStart, preorder, postorder)`:
-   If `preStart > preEnd`, i.e. there are no more nodes to process, return `NULL`.
-   If $preStart = preEnd$, the tree contains only one node:
-   Return a new node with value $\text{preorder}[preStart]$ and no children.
-   Define `leftRoot` as the second element of the current portion of the preorder array, i.e., $preorder[preStart + 1]$.
-   Initialize `numOfNodesInLeft` to `1`.
-   Iterate over the current portion of the `postorder` array until `leftRoot` is found. While $postorder[postStart + numOfNodesInLeft - 1] \neq leftRoot$:
-   Increment `numOfNodesInLeft` by `1`.
-   Create a new node `root` and set its value to $\text{preorder}[preStart]$.
-   Recursively construct the left subtree of root by calling $constructTree(preStart + 1, preStart + numOfNodesInLeft, postStart, preorder, postorder)$.
-   Construct the right subtree by calling: $constructTree(preStart + numOfNodesInLeft + 1, preEnd, postStart + numOfNodesInLeft, preorder, postorder)$.
-   Return `root`.
-   In the main `constructFromPrePost` function:
-  Initialize `numOfNodes` to the size of the traversal arrays.
-  Call the helper function $constructTree(preStart = 0, preEnd = numOfNodes - 1, postStart = 0, preorder, postorder)$ and return the root of the constructed tree.

#### Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def constructFromPrePost(
        self, preorder: List[int], postorder: List[int]
    ) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        num_of_nodes = len(preorder)
        return self._construct_tree(0, num_of_nodes - 1, 0, preorder, postorder)

    # Helper function to construct the tree recursively
    def _construct_tree(
        self,
        pre_start: int,
        pre_end: int,
        post_start: int,
        preorder: List[int],
        postorder: List[int],
    ) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        # Base case: If there are no nodes to process, return None
        if pre_start > pre_end:
            return None

        # Base case: If only one node is left, return that node
        if pre_start == pre_end:
            return TreeNode(preorder[pre_start])

        # The left child root in preorder traversal (next element after root)
        left_root = preorder[pre_start + 1]

        # Calculate the number of nodes in the left subtree by searching in postorder
        num_of_nodes_in_left = 1
        while postorder[post_start + num_of_nodes_in_left - 1] != left_root:
            num_of_nodes_in_left += 1

        root = TreeNode(preorder[pre_start])

        # Recursively construct the left subtree
        root.left = self._construct_tree(
            pre_start + 1,
            pre_start + num_of_nodes_in_left,
            post_start,
            preorder,
            postorder,
        )

        # Recursively construct the right subtree
        root.right = self._construct_tree(
            pre_start + num_of_nodes_in_left + 1,
            pre_end,
            post_start + num_of_nodes_in_left,
            preorder,
            postorder,
        )

        return root
```

#### Complexity Analysis

Let $n$ be the size of the traversal arrays.

-   Time complexity: $O(n^2)$

    We call the `constructTree` function $n$ times, once for each element in the preorder array. In each call, the function makes a linear pass over the `postorder` array to find the position of the element that matches the root of the left subtree. This means each call to `constructTree` takes $O(n)$ time, and with $n$ calls in total, the overall time complexity is $O(n^2)$.

-   Space complexity: $O(n)$

    Since we are not using any additional data structures other than the input arrays and the result tree, the space complexity is determined by the depth of the recursion. In the worst case, where the tree is a list of nodes with only left children, the recursion will go $O(n)$ levels deep, one for each node. Therefore, the algorithm requires $O(n)$ extra space.

---

### Approach 2: Using Index Array

#### Intuition

Looking at our previous approach, we see that searching through the `postorder` array in each call to `constructTree` adds an extra $O(n)$ time cost, slowing down the algorithm. How can we remove this bottleneck while using the fact that all node values are unique?

An intuitive solution might be to use a hash map to store the index of each node value in `postorder`. This allows quick lookups and helps us determine how many nodes belong to each subtree efficiently. While this works well and keeps the time and space complexity the same, we can optimize further. Since node values do not exceed the length of the traversal arrays, we can use an index array instead of a hash map. This improves both runtime and auxiliary space usage.

So, in the preprocessing phase, we create an index array by storing the position of each element in the post-order traversal. This index array replaces the need for the original post-order array in recursion.

The algorithm then follows the same structure: the first node in the current preorder segment is the root, and the second is the root of its left subtree (`leftRoot`). By finding the index of `leftRoot` in post-order, we determine the left subtree's size and split the problem into two smaller subproblems. We then recursively build the left and right subtrees using the relevant subarrays.

#### Algorithm

-   Define the recursive function `constructTree(preStart, preEnd, postStart, preorder, indexInPostorder)`:
-   If `preStart > preEnd`, meaning that there are no more nodes to process, return `NULL`.
-   If $preStart = preEnd$, the tree contains only one node:
-   Return a new node with value $\text{preorder}[preStart]$ and no children.
-   Define `leftRoot` as the second element of the current portion of the preorder array, i.e., $preorder[preStart + 1]$.
-   Initialize `numOfNodesInLeft` to $\text{indexInPostorder}[leftRoot] - postStart + 1$, indicating the number of nodes that occur before `leftRoot` in `postorder` and should be added to the left subtree.
-   Create a new node `root` and set its value to $\text{preorder}[preStart]$.
-   Recursively construct the left subtree of `root` by calling: $constructTree(preStart + 1, preStart + numOfNodesLeft, postStart, preorder, indexInPostorder)$.
-   Construct the right subtree by calling: $constructTree(preStart + numOfNodesInLeft + 1, preEnd, postStart + numOfNodesInLeft, preorder, indexInPostorder)$.
-   Return `root`.
-   In the main `constructFromPrePost` function:
-  Initialize `numOfNodes` to the size of the traversal arrays.
-  Create an index array `indexInPostorder` of size $numOfNodes + 1$.
-  Iterate over `postorder` and for each element store its index in the `indexInPostorder` array.
-  Call the helper function $constructTree(preStart = 0, preEnd = numOfNodes - 1, postStart = 0, preorder, indexInPostorder)$ and return the root of the constructed tree.

#### Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def constructFromPrePost(
        self, preorder: List[int], postorder: List[int]
    ) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        num_of_nodes = len(preorder)

        # Create the index list for `postorder`
        index_in_post_order = [0] * (num_of_nodes + 1)
        for index in range(num_of_nodes):
            # Store the index of the current element
            index_in_post_order[postorder[index]] = index

        return self._construct_tree(
            0, num_of_nodes - 1, 0, preorder, index_in_post_order
        )

    # Helper function to construct the tree recursively
    def _construct_tree(
        self,
        pre_start: int,
        pre_end: int,
        post_start: int,
        preorder: List[int],
        index_in_post_order: List[int],
    ) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        # Base case: If there are no nodes to process, return None
        if pre_start > pre_end:
            return None

        # Base case: If only one node is left, return that node
        if pre_start == pre_end:
            return TreeNode(preorder[pre_start])

        # The left child root in preorder traversal (next element after root)
        left_root = preorder[pre_start + 1]

        # Calculate the number of nodes in the left subtree by searching in postorder
        num_of_nodes_in_left = index_in_post_order[left_root] - post_start + 1

        root = TreeNode(preorder[pre_start])

        # Recursively construct the left subtree
        root.left = self._construct_tree(
            pre_start + 1,
            pre_start + num_of_nodes_in_left,
            post_start,
            preorder,
            index_in_post_order,
        )

        # Recursively construct the right subtree
        root.right = self._construct_tree(
            pre_start + num_of_nodes_in_left + 1,
            pre_end,
            post_start + num_of_nodes_in_left,
            preorder,
            index_in_post_order,
        )

        return root
```

#### Complexity Analysis

Let $n$ be the size of the traversal arrays.

-   Time complexity: $O(n)$

    The `constructTree` function is called exactly $n$ times, once for each node in the tree. Unlike the previous approach, each call handles a constant amount of work because subtree sizes are computed in constant time using the `indexInPostorder` array. As a result, the overall time complexity remains $O(n)$.

-   Space complexity: $O(n)$

    The `indexInPostorder` array requires $O(n)$ space, as it stores the index of each element in the `postorder` traversal. Additionally, in the worst case, the recursion depth can reach $n$ levels, leading to a total space complexity of $O(n)$ for both recursion and auxiliary data structures.

---

### Approach 3: Optimized Recursion

#### Intuition

In the previous approaches, we explicitly searched for the dividing point between the left and right subtrees using `postorder`, which introduced an additional lookup step. Here we remove that extra search by dynamically determining subtree boundaries as we traverse the arrays, making the recursion more efficient.

The core idea is to process nodes in preorder to determine which nodes to create and use postorder to recognize when a subtree is complete. Since preorder always visits nodes in the order Root → Left → Right, each recursive call picks the next node from `preorder` and assigns it as the root of the current subtree. Meanwhile, since postorder follows Left → Right → Root, a subtree is fully processed when we encounter its root in `postorder`. To track this, we maintain an index `posIndex` that moves forward as nodes get finalized.

To construct the tree, we first check if the current root’s value matches $\text{postorder}[posIndex]$. If it does, the subtree ends at this node, meaning it has no children. Otherwise, we attempt to construct the left subtree by making a recursive call. If the next value still doesn’t match $\text{postorder}[posIndex]$, it means there must also be a right subtree, so we make another recursive call to construct it.

Once both subtrees are built, we move `posIndex` forward to mark this node and its subtree as fully processed.

#### Algorithm

-   Define the recursive function `constructTree(preIndex, postIndex, preorder, postorder)`:
-   Create a new node `root` with value $\text{preorder}[preIndex]$.
-   Increment `preIndex` by `1` to mark this node as created.
-   If the value of root is not equal to $\text{postorder}[postIndex]$, meaning that the node has children:
-   Recursively construct the left subtree using: `constructTree(preIndex, postIndex, preorder, postorder)`.
-   If the value of `root` is still not equal to $\text{postorder}[postIndex]$, the node has a right child as well:
-   Construct the right subtree using: `constructTree(preIndex, postIndex, preorder, postorder)`.
-   Increment `postIndex` by `1` to mark this node and its subtree as processed.
-   Return `root`.
-   In the main `constructFromPrePost` function:
-   Initialize two variables, $preIndex = 0$, $postIndex = 0$.
-   Create the tree using `constructTree(preIndex, postIndex, preorder, postorder)` and return it.

#### Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def __init__(self):
        self.pre_index = 0
        self.post_index = 0

    # Helper function to recursively build the tree
    def constructFromPrePost(
        self, preorder: List[int], postorder: List[int]
    ) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        return self._construct_tree(preorder, postorder)

    def _construct_tree(
        self, preorder: List[int], postorder: List[int]
    ) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        root = TreeNode(preorder[self.pre_index])
        self.pre_index += 1

        # Recursively construct the left subtree if the root is not the last of
        # its subtree
        if root.val != postorder[self.post_index]:
            root.left = self._construct_tree(preorder, postorder)

        # Recursively construct the right subtree if the root is not the last of
        # its subtree
        if root.val != postorder[self.post_index]:
            root.right = self._construct_tree(preorder, postorder)

        # Mark this node and its subtree as fully processed
        self.post_index += 1
        return root
```

#### Complexity Analysis

Let $n$ be the size of the traversal arrays.

-   Time complexity: $O(n)$

    We are making $n$ recursive calls, one for each node in the tree. Each call of the `constructTree` function involves only constant-time operations, like comparing values and incrementing pointers, and therefore the overall time complexity is $O(n)$.

-   Space complexity: $O(n)$

    Since we are not using any additional data structures, the auxiliary space complexity is determined by the recursion depth. In the worst case (when the `postorder` array contains the nodes in reverse order from the `preorder` array), we make $n$ recursive calls to create all the nodes before starting to backtrack. Therefore, the recursion depth can reach $O(n)$, which also corresponds to the space complexity of the algorithm.
