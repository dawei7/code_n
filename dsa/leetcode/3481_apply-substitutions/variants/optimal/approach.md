## General
Given a `replacements` mapping and a `text` string that may contain **placeholders** formatted as `%var%`, where each `var` corresponds to a key in the `replacements` mapping. Each replacement value may itself contain **one..., the algorithm executes depth-first search (DFS) recursion to explore valid decision branches. It utilizes a hash map (`dict`) to store element values and their indices/frequencies for $O(1)$ fast access. Edge case handling: applies modulo arithmetic to prevent integer overflow.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(L + E)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(E + k)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
