## General
### Beginner-Friendly Intuition & Strategy
The core task in **Network Recovery Pathways** is to a directed acyclic graph of `n` nodes numbered from 0 to `n − 1`. This is represented by a 2D array `edges` of length `m`, where $\text{edges}[i] = [u_{i}, v_{i}, \text{cost}_{i}]$ indicates a one‑way communication from node $u_{i}$ to node $v_{i}$ with a recovery cost of $\te.... Instead of using nested loops that inspect every pair in $O(n^2)$ time, this algorithm uses the **Two-Pointer technique**. We place two markers (pointers)—typically one at the start (`left`) and one at the end (`right`) of a sorted array—and move them toward each other based on clear comparison rules, completing the search in a single efficient pass.

### Step-by-Step Execution Guide
**Step 1: Setup & Base Cases**  
We initialize an empty hash map (`dict`) to act as our fast memory bank, storing elements and their indices or frequencies.  
**Step 2: Core Processing & Traversal**  
1. Compare elements at `array[left]` and `array[right]`.  
2. Advance `left` or retreat `right` based on comparison rules.  
**Step 3: Completion & Return**  
Bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`) allow ultra-fast bitmask updates in $O(1)$ hardware instructions.  
When processing finishes, the algorithm outputs the final validated solution.

### Why This Handles Edge Cases Gracefully
- **Empty / Null Inputs:** Early guard checks return empty results immediately without crashing.


## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O((n + m) log m)$ — Detailed Analysis: The time complexity corresponds directly to the total number of operations required by the step-by-step execution loop described above.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(n + m)$ — Detailed Analysis: The space complexity reflects the auxiliary memory allocated for tracking structures, recursion stack depth, or hash maps during processing.
