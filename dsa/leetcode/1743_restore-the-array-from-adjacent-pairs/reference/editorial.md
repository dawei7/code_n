### Approach 1: Depth-First Search (DFS)

**Intuition**

In this problem, we are given information about numbers that are adjacent to each other in some array `nums`. We can think of these pairs in `adjacentPairs` as edges in a graph: if we have a pair `(x, y)`, we can imagine that there is an undirected edge between node `x` and `y`.

This graph would form a doubly-linked list, since the edges, by definition, only describe adjacent elements. In fact, this doubly-linked list would represent `nums`, since the adjacent elements are adjacent elements in `nums`!

This simplifies our problem: to recover `nums`, we simply need to perform a traversal over the graph, starting from one end of the "linked list". This is because as stated above, the graph/linked list represents `nums`. Thus, if we start at either end, we will continuously visit adjacent numbers one by one until we reach the other end, which is equivalent to iterating over the elements of `nums` in order.

This brings us to the question: how do we find either end of the graph/linked list, so that we know where to start the traversal from? From the above image, there are two ends: `1` and `4`. You may notice that these nodes only have one edge, whereas other nodes have exactly two edges. This is because every node has a node to its left and to its right, **except** for the nodes at the ends.

Thus, we can identify a `root` as a node that only has one edge. Once we have a `root`, we will perform a DFS from it.

It is typical in a DFS over a graph to use a data structure (usually a hash map) `seen` that keeps track of nodes we have already visited. In this problem, since the graph essentially forms a doubly linked list, we don't need to use any data structure. We simply need to keep track of the previous node we visited `prev`. Each node can have at most two edges: the node we came from, and a node we haven't visited yet. By keeping track of `prev` and not traversing to it, we ensure that we walk in a straight line and never visit a node twice.

At each `node` during the traversal, we add `node` to an answer list `ans`. Once the traversal is finished, `ans` will be a valid `nums`.

**Algorithm**

1. Initialize a `graph`, where $\text{graph}[node]$ holds a list of neighbors for `node`.
2. Iterate over each edge `(x, y)` in `adjacentPairs`:
- Add `y` to $\text{graph}[x]$.
- Add `x` to $\text{graph}[y]$.
3. Iterate over each `num` in `graph`:
- If the length of $\text{graph}[num]$ is equal to `1`, set $root = num$ and break from the loop.
4. Define a function `dfs(node, prev, ans)`:
- Add `node` to `ans`.
- Iterate over each `neighbor` in $\text{graph}[node]$:
- If $neighbor \neq prev$:
- Call `dfs(neighbor, node, ans)`.
5. Initialize the answer list `ans`.
6. Call `dfs(root, k, ans)`, where `k` can be any value that is guaranteed to not appear in the graph, such as infinity.
7. Return `ans`.

**Implementation**

```python
class Solution:
    def restoreArray(self, adjacentPairs: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        graph = defaultdict(list)

        for x, y in adjacentPairs:
            graph[x].append(y)
            graph[y].append(x)

        root = None
        for num in graph:
            if len(graph[num]) == 1:
                root = num
                break

        def dfs(node, prev, ans):
            ans.append(node)
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if neighbor != prev:
                    dfs(neighbor, node, ans)

        ans = []
        dfs(root, None, ans)
        return ans
```

**Complexity Analysis**

Given $n$ as the length of the hypothetical `nums`,

* Time complexity: $O(n)$

    Note that the length of `adjacentPairs` is equal to $n - 1$.

    We first build `graph`, which involves iterating over $O(n)$ edges. Next, we find `root`, which may cost $O(n)$ iterations. Finally, we perform a DFS.

    In the DFS, we never visit a node more than once. At each node, we perform $O(1)$ work. Thus, the DFS costs $O(n)$.

* Space complexity: $O(n)$

    When performing the DFS, the recursive call stack uses $O(n)$ space. Also, `graph` will have a size of $O(n)$.

### Approach 2: Iterative, Follow the Path

**Intuition**

As we discussed in the previous approach, the graph of this problem is essentially a linked list, so we don't need any algorithm like DFS or BFS (Breadth-First Search) to traverse it. We can just iteratively traverse it like we would a linked list.

Here, we implement `graph` and find `root` in the same manner as the previous approach.

Next, instead of a DFS, we use a variable `curr` that represents the current node. We also use a variable `prev` to indicate the previously visited node, to ensure we only move in a straight line. Note that the length of `graph` will be equal to the length of `nums` since each number in `nums` has at least one edge, and thus an entry in `graph`.

With this in mind, we will have a while loop that runs until $\text{ans.length} = \text{graph.length}$, indicating we have finished building `ans`. In this while loop, we iterate over each `neighbor` of $\text{graph}[curr]$. If $neighbor \neq prev$, it is the next node we should go to. We add `neighbor` to `ans`, update `prev` and `curr` accordingly, then break from the iteration to move on to the next node.

Once the while loop ends, we know that `ans` is complete, so we can simply return `ans`.

**Algorithm**

1. Initialize a `graph`, where $\text{graph}[node]$ holds a list of neighbors for `node`.
2. Iterate over each edge `(x, y)` in `adjacentPairs`:
- Add `y` to $\text{graph}[x]$.
- Add `x` to $\text{graph}[y]$.
3. Iterate over each `num` in `graph`:
- If the length of $\text{graph}[num]$ is equal to `1`, set $root = num$ and break from the loop.
4. Initialize the following variables:
- $curr = root$ as the current node.
- $ans = [root]$ as the answer list.
- `prev` as the previous node we saw. Initialize it to any value that can't be in the graph, like infinity.
5. While the length of `ans` is less than the length of `graph`:
- Iterate over each `neighbor` of $\text{graph}[curr]$:
- If $neighbor \neq prev$:
- Add `neighbor` to `ans`.
- Update $prev = curr$.
- Update $curr = neighbor$.
- Break from the iteration.
6. Return `ans`.

**Implementation**

```python
class Solution:
    def restoreArray(self, adjacentPairs: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        graph = defaultdict(list)

        for x, y in adjacentPairs:
            graph[x].append(y)
            graph[y].append(x)

        root = None
        for num in graph:
            if len(graph[num]) == 1:
                root = num
                break

        curr = root
        ans = [root]
        prev = None

        while len(ans) < len(graph):
            for neighbor in graph[curr]:
                if neighbor != prev:
                    ans.append(neighbor)
                    prev = curr
                    curr = neighbor
                    break

        return ans
```

**Complexity Analysis**

Given $n$ as the length of the hypothetical `nums`,

* Time complexity: $O(n)$

    Note that the length of `adjacentPairs` is equal to $n - 1$.

    We first build `graph`, which involves iterating over $O(n)$ edges. Next, we find `root`, which may cost $O(n)$ iterations.

    Finally, we iterate over each node in order. At each node, we perform $O(1)$ work. Thus, this iteration costs $O(n)$ for $O(n)$ nodes.

* Space complexity: $O(n)$

    `graph` uses $O(n)$ space.
