## Description

You are given an array of variable pairs `equations` and an array of real numbers `values`, where `equations[i] = [A_i, B_i]` and `values[i]` represent the equation `A_i / B_i = values[i]`. Each `A_i` or `B_i` is a string that represents a single variable.

You are also given some `queries`, where `queries[j] = [C_j, D_j]` represents the `j^th` query where you must find the answer for `C_j / D_j = ?`.

Return *the answers to all queries*. If a single answer cannot be determined, return `-1.0`.

**Note:** The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will not result in division by zero and that there is no contradiction.

**Note: **The variables that do not occur in the list of equations are undefined, so the answer cannot be determined for them.
