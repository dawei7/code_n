## Description

You are given a directed, weighted graph with `n` nodes labeled from 0 to `n - 1`, and an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i, w_i]` represents a directed edge from node `u_i` to node `v_i` with cost `w_i`.

Each node `u_i` has a switch that can be used **at most once**: when you arrive at `u_i` and have not yet used its switch, you may activate it on one of its incoming edges `v_i → u_i` reverse that edge to `u_i → v_i` and **immediately** traverse it.

The reversal is only valid for that single move, and using a reversed edge costs `2 * w_i`.

Return the **minimum** total cost to travel from node 0 to node `n - 1`. If it is not possible, return -1.
