## Description

A **complete binary tree** is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.

Design an algorithm to insert a new node to a complete binary tree keeping it complete after the insertion.

Implement the `CBTInserter` class:

<ul>
	<li>`CBTInserter(TreeNode root)` Initializes the data structure with the `root` of the complete binary tree.</li>
	<li>`int insert(int v)` Inserts a `TreeNode` into the tree with value `Node.val == val` so that the tree remains complete, and returns the value of the parent of the inserted `TreeNode`.</li>
	<li>`TreeNode get_root()` Returns the root node of the tree.</li>
</ul>
