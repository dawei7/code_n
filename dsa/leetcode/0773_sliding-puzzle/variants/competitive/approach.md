## General
Given On an `2 x 3` board, there are five tiles labeled from `1` to `5`, and an empty square represented by `0`. A **move** consists of choosing `0` and a 4-directionally adjacent number and swapping it, the algorithm executes a single-pass linear scan through input elements. It utilizes a hash map (`dict`) to store element values and their indices/frequencies for $O(1)$ fast access, a hash set (`set`) to track unique elements and prevent duplicate processing in $O(1)$ time, a priority queue (`heapq`) to maintain dynamic minimum/maximum element ordering. Edge case handling: guards against empty/null inputs via early returns, applies modulo arithmetic to prevent integer overflow.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(V+E)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(V)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
