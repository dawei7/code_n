## General
Given On an `2 x 3` board, there are five tiles labeled from `1` to `5`, and an empty square represented by `0`. A **move** consists of choosing `0` and a 4-directionally adjacent number and swapping it, the algorithm executes breadth-first search (BFS) level-order traversal using a queue. It utilizes a hash map (`dict`) to store element values and their indices/frequencies for $O(1)$ fast access, a double-ended queue (`deque`) to support dynamic $O(1)$ push and pop operations at both ends.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(V+E)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(V)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
