### Approach: Enumerate Two Characters + Two Pointers

#### Intuition

Since the string $s$ only contains digit characters `[0, 4]`, we can first enumerate the characters $a$ and $b$ described in the problem, where $a$ must appear an odd number of times, $b$ must appear an even number of times, and $a$ and $b$ must be different. The parity of the number of occurrences of a character can be represented by a binary bit, where $0$ indicates an even count and $1$ indicates an odd count. We place the parity of $a$'s occurrences in front and the parity of $b$'s at the end, resulting in 4 possible cases: `[00, 01, 10, 11]`. The string we are looking for must correspond to the $10$ case.

We consider a two-pointer approach, where the right pointer $\textit{right}$ moves one step at a time, representing the right endpoint of the current substring. As it moves, we update the count of $a$ and $b$ up to index $\textit{right}$, denoted as $\textit{cnt}_a$ and $\textit{cnt}_b$, and compute the corresponding state:

$\textit{status}_\textit{right} = (\textit{cnt}_a \bmod 2) \times 2 + (\textit{cnt}_b \bmod 2)$

At the same time, the left pointer $\textit{left}$ only advances when certain conditions are met. That is, only indices less than or equal to $\textit{left}$ can serve as the left endpoint of a valid substring. We use $\textit{prev}_a$ and $\textit{prev}_b$ to record the count of $a$ and $b$ up to index $\textit{left}$, and move $\textit{left}$ only when both conditions below are satisfied:

- $\textit{right} - \textit{left} \geq k$, i.e., the substring length is at least $k$.

- $\textit{cnt}_b - \textit{prev}_b \geq 2$, meaning $b$ appears an even number of times in the substring, but zero occurrences must be excluded.

For any such valid $\textit{left}$, the corresponding result is $(\textit{cnt}_a - \textit{cnt}_b) - (\textit{prev}_a - \textit{prev}_b)$. Therefore, we maintain a length-4 array $\textit{best}$ that keeps track of the minimum value of $\textit{prev}_a - \textit{prev}_b$ for each possible state:

$\textit{status}_\textit{left} = (\textit{prev}_a \bmod 2) \times 2 + (\textit{prev}_b \bmod 2)$

We then use $\textit{prev}_a - \textit{prev}b$ to update $\textit{best}[\textit{status}\textit{left}]$.

After moving the left pointer, we compute the answer for the current right pointer. Since we are looking for substrings with state $10$, the required left endpoint must have the state $\textit{status}_\textit{right} \oplus (10)_2$, where $\oplus$ denotes the XOR operation. So the answer becomes:

$(\textit{cnt}_a - \textit{cnt}_b) - \textit{best}[\textit{status}_\textit{right} \oplus (10)_2]$

We return the maximum value among all such results as the final answer.

#### Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def maxDifference(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        def getStatus(cnt_a: int, cnt_b: int) -> int:
            return ((cnt_a & 1) << 1) | (cnt_b & 1)

        n = len(s)
        ans = float("-inf")
        for a in ["0", "1", "2", "3", "4"]:
            for b in ["0", "1", "2", "3", "4"]:
                if a == b:
                    continue

                best = [float("inf")] * 4
                cnt_a = cnt_b = 0
                prev_a = prev_b = 0
                left = -1
                for right in range(n):
                    cnt_a += s[right] == a
                    cnt_b += s[right] == b
                    while right - left >= k and cnt_b - prev_b >= 2:
                        left_status = getStatus(prev_a, prev_b)
                        best[left_status] = min(
                            best[left_status], prev_a - prev_b
                        )
                        left += 1
                        prev_a += s[left] == a
                        prev_b += s[left] == b

                    right_status = getStatus(cnt_a, cnt_b)
                    if best[right_status ^ 0b10] != float("inf"):
                        ans = max(
                            ans, cnt_a - cnt_b - best[right_status ^ 0b10]
                        )

        return ans
```

#### Complexity Analysis

Let $n$ be the length of the string $s$, and let $|\Sigma|$ denote the size of the character set. Since $s$ contains only the digits `[0, 4]`, we have $|\Sigma| = 5$.

- Time complexity: $O(n\times|\Sigma|^2)$.

  Enumerating all possible pairs of characters $(a, b)$ takes $O(|\Sigma|^2)$ time. For each such pair, we apply a two-pointer approach using $\textit{left}$ and $\textit{right}$ to compute the answer. Each pointer traverses the string at most once, resulting in $O(n)$ time per pair. Hence, the total time complexity is $O(n \times |\Sigma|^2)$.

- Space complexity: $O(1)$.

  Only a few additional variables are needed.
