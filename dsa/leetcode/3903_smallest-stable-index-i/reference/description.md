## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `k`.

For each index `i`, define its **instability score** as `max(nums[0..i]) - min(nums[i..n - 1])`.

In other words:

<ul>
	<li>`max(nums[0..i])` is the **largest** value among the elements from index 0 to index `i`.</li>
	<li>`min(nums[i..n - 1])` is the **smallest** value among the elements from index `i` to index `n - 1`.</li>
</ul>

An index `i` is called **stable** if its instability score is **less than or equal to** `k`.

Return the **smallest** stable index. If no such index exists, return -1.
