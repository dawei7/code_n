## Description

You are given an array of strings `words` and an integer `k`.

Two words `a` and `b` at **distinct indices** are **<span data-keyword="string-prefix">prefix</span>-connected** if `a[0..k-1] == b[0..k-1]`.

A **connected group** is a set of words such that each pair of words is prefix-connected.

Return the **number of connected groups** that contain **at least** two words, formed from the given words.

**Note:**

<ul>
	<li>Words with length less than `k` cannot join any group and are ignored.</li>
	<li>Duplicate strings are treated as separate words.</li>
</ul>
