## General
Given an integer array `nums` of length `n` where all the integers of `nums` are in the range `[1, n]` and each integer appears **at most** **twice**, return *an array of all the integers that appears **twice***, the algorithm executes a single-pass linear scan through input elements. It utilizes a hash map (`dict`) to store element values and their indices/frequencies for $O(1)$ fast access.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
