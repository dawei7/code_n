## General
Given an integer `n`. You roll a fair 6-sided dice `n` times. Determine the total number of **distinct** sequences of rolls possible such that the following conditions are satisfied:, the algorithm executes a single-pass linear scan through input elements. It utilizes a hash map (`dict`) to store element values and their indices/frequencies for $O(1)$ fast access, a dynamic programming memoization table to cache intermediate subproblem states. Edge case handling: applies modulo arithmetic to prevent integer overflow.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
