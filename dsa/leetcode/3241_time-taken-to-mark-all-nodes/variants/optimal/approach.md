## General
Given There exists an **undirected** tree with `n` nodes numbered `0` to $n - 1$. You are given a 2D integer array `edges` of length $n - 1$, where $\text{edges}[i] = [u_{i}, v_{i}]$ indicates that there is an edge between ..., the algorithm executes a single-pass linear scan through input elements. It utilizes a hash map (`dict`) to store element values and their indices/frequencies for $O(1)$ fast access. Edge case handling: applies modulo arithmetic to prevent integer overflow.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(n)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
