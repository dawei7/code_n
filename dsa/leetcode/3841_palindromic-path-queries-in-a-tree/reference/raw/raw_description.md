## Description

You are given an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled 0 to `n - 1`. This is represented by a 2D array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]` indicates an undirected edge between nodes `u_i` and `v_i`.

You are also given a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters, where `s[i]` represents the character assigned to node `i`.

You are also given a string array `queries`, where each `queries[i]` is either:

	- `"update u_i c"`: Change the character at node `u_i` to `c`. Formally, update `s[u_i] = c`.

	- `"query u_i v_i"`: Determine whether the string formed by the characters on the **unique** path from `u_i` to `v_i` (inclusive) can be **rearranged** into a **<span data-keyword="palindrome-string">palindrome</span>**.

Return a boolean array `answer`, where `answer[j]` is `true` if the `j^th` query of type `"query u_i v_i"​​​​​​​` can be rearranged into a **palindrome**, and `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**

<div class="example-block">
**Input:** <span class="example-io">n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2]], s = "aac", queries = ["query 0 2","update 1 b","query 0 2"]</span>

**Output:** <span class="example-io">[true,false]</span>

**Explanation:**

	- `"query 0 2"`: Path `0 → 1 → 2` gives `"aac"`, which can be rearranged to form `"aca"`, a palindrome. Thus, `answer[0] = true`.

	- `"update 1 b"`: Update node 1 to `'b'`, now `s = "abc"`.

	- `"query 0 2"`: Path characters are `"abc"`, which cannot be rearranged to form a palindrome. Thus, `answer[1] = false`.

Thus, `answer = [true, false]`.

</div>

**Example 2:**

<div class="example-block">
**Input:** <span class="example-io">n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3]], s = "abca", queries = ["query 1 2","update 0 b","query 2 3","update 3 a","query 1 3"]</span>

**Output:** <span class="example-io">[false,false,true]</span>

**Explanation:**

	- `"query 1 2"`: Path `1 → 0 → 2` gives `"bac"`, which cannot be rearranged to form a palindrome. Thus, `answer[0] = false`.

	- `"update 0 b"`: Update node 0 to `'b'`, now `s = "bbca"`.

	- `"query 2 3"`: Path `2 → 0 → 3` gives `"cba"`, which cannot be rearranged to form a palindrome. Thus, `answer[1] = false`.

	- `"update 3 a"`: Update node 3 to `'a'`, `s = "bbca"`.

	- `"query 1 3"`: Path `1 → 0 → 3` gives `"bba"`, which can be rearranged to form `"bab"`, a palindrome. Thus, `answer[2] = true`.

Thus, `answer = [false, false, true]`.

</div>

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n == s.length <= 5 * 10^4`

	- `edges.length == n - 1`

	- `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]`

	- `0 <= u_i, v_i <= n - 1`

	- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

	- The input is generated such that `edges` represents a valid tree.

	- `1 <= queries.length <= 5 * 10^4`​​​​​​​

		<li>`queries[i] = "update u_i c"` or

		- `queries[i] = "query u_i v_i"`

		- `0 <= u_i, v_i <= n - 1`

		- `c` is a lowercase English letter.

	</li>
