## General
### Beginner-Friendly Strategy
To Write code that enhances all date objects such that you can call the `date.nextDay()` method on any date object and it will return the next day in the format *YYYY-MM-DD* as a string, the JavaScript solution uses clean ES6+ techniques.

### Step-by-Step Execution Guide
**Step 1: Setup** — Initializes fast lookup structures such as `Map` or `Set` for $O(1)$ fast lookups.  
**Step 2: Processing** — Uses built-in array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`) or clean loops to process data.  

### Edge Case Handling
- **Empty Arrays / Edge Cases:** Checked via `length` guards to prevent runtime crashes.


## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(1)$ — Detailed Analysis: The time complexity corresponds directly to the total number of operations required by the step-by-step execution loop described above.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$ — Detailed Analysis: The space complexity reflects the auxiliary memory allocated for tracking structures, recursion stack depth, or hash maps during processing.
