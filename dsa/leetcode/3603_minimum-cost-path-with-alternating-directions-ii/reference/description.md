## Description

You are given two integers `m` and `n` representing the number of rows and columns of a grid, respectively.

The cost to enter cell `(i, j)` is defined as `(i + 1) * (j + 1)`.

You are also given a 2D integer array `waitCost` where `waitCost[i][j]` defines the cost to **wait** on that cell.

The path will always begin by entering cell `(0, 0)` on move 1 and paying the entrance cost.

At each step, you follow an alternating pattern:

<ul>
	<li>On **odd-numbered** seconds, you must move **right** or **down** to an **adjacent** cell, paying its entry cost.</li>
	<li>On **even-numbered** seconds, you must **wait** in place for **exactly** one second and pay `waitCost[i][j]` during that second.</li>
</ul>

Return the **minimum** total cost required to reach `(m - 1, n - 1)`.
