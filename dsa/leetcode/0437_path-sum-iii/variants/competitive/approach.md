## General
Given the `root` of a binary tree and an integer `targetSum`, return *the number of paths where the sum of the values along the path equals* `targetSum`, the algorithm solves **Path Sum III** directly. It utilizes a hash map (`dict`) to store element values and their indices/frequencies for $O(1)$ fast access, binary tree node references (`val`, `left`, `right`) to traverse structural hierarchies. Key operations include bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`) for fast bitmask state updates. Edge case handling: guards against empty/null inputs via early returns.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(n)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
