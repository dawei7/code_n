## Description

A string can be abbreviated by replacing any number of non-adjacent substrings with their lengths. For example, a string such as `"substitution"` could be abbreviated as (but not limited to):
- `"s10n"` (`"s ubstitutio n"`)
- `"sub4u4"` (`"sub stit u tion"`)
- `"12"` (`"substitution"`)
- `"su3i1u2on"` (`"su bst i t u ti on"`)
- `"substitution"` (no substrings replaced)

Note that `"s55n"` (`"s ubsti tutio n"`) is not a valid abbreviation of `"substitution"` because the replaced substrings are adjacent.

The length of an abbreviation is the number of letters that were not replaced plus the number of substrings that were replaced. For example, the abbreviation `"s10n"` has a length of 3 (2 letters + 1 substring) and `"su3i1u2on"` has a length of 9 (6 letters + 3 substrings).

Given a target string `target` and an array of strings `dictionary`, return *an abbreviation of* `target` *with the **shortest possible length** such that it is **not an abbreviation** of any string in* `dictionary`. If there are multiple shortest abbreviations, return any of them.
