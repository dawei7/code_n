## General
Given an array of integers called `nums`, you can perform **any** of the following operation while `nums` contains **at least** `2` elements:, the algorithm executes a two-pointer approach to shrink boundaries or maintain a sliding window. It utilizes a dynamic programming memoization table to cache intermediate subproblem states. Key operations include bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`) for fast bitmask state updates. Edge case handling: guards against empty/null inputs via early returns.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n^2)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(n)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
