## Description

A split of an integer array is **good** if:

<ul>
	<li>The array is split into three **non-empty** contiguous subarrays - named `left`, `mid`, `right` respectively from left to right.</li>
	<li>The sum of the elements in `left` is less than or equal to the sum of the elements in `mid`, and the sum of the elements in `mid` is less than or equal to the sum of the elements in `right`.</li>
</ul>

Given `nums`, an array of **non-negative** integers, return *the number of **good** ways to split* `nums`. As the number may be too large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.
