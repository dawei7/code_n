## General
### Beginner-Friendly Intuition & Strategy
The core task in **Paint House IV** is to an **even** integer `n` representing the number of houses arranged in a straight line, and a 2D array `cost` of size `n x 3`, where $\text{cost}[i][j]$ represents the cost of painting house `i` with color $j + 1$. Instead of recalculating the exact same subproblems over and over again, this solution uses **Dynamic Programming**. We break the larger problem down into smaller overlapping subproblems, solve each subproblem once, and store its result in a memory table. When building the final answer, we simply look up previously calculated answers.

### Step-by-Step Execution Guide
**Step 1: Setup & Base Cases**  
We create a Dynamic Programming table and initialize known base cases.  
**Step 2: Core Processing & Traversal**  
1. Calculate `mid = (left + right) // 2`.  
2. Compare `array[mid]` with target value.  
3. Adjust `left = mid + 1` or `right = mid - 1` to halve the search window.  
**Step 3: Completion & Return**  
When processing finishes, the algorithm outputs the final validated solution.

### Why This Handles Edge Cases Gracefully
- **Single Element / Border Cases:** Loop bounds handle single items and empty inputs naturally.


## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n)$ — Detailed Analysis: The time complexity corresponds directly to the total number of operations required by the step-by-step execution loop described above.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$ — Detailed Analysis: The space complexity reflects the auxiliary memory allocated for tracking structures, recursion stack depth, or hash maps during processing.
