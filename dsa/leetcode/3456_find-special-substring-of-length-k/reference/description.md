### 1. Description

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`.

Determine if there exists a substring of length **exactly** `k` in `s` that satisfies the following conditions:

- The substring consists of **only one distinct character** (e.g., `"aaa"` or `"bbb"`).

- If there is a character **immediately before** the substring, it must be different from the character in the substring.

- If there is a character **immediately after** the substring, it must also be different from the character in the substring.

Return `true` if such a substring exists. Otherwise, return `false`.

### 2. Function Contract

- `n`: Input parameter.
- Returns expected result.

### 3. Examples

#### Example 1

<div class="example-block">
**Input:** s = "aaabaaa", k = 3

**Output:** true

**Explanation:**

The substring $s[4..6] = "aaa"$ satisfies the conditions.

- It has a length of 3.

- All characters are the same.

- The character before `"aaa"` is `'b'`, which is different from `'a'`.

- There is no character after `"aaa"`.

</div>
#### Example 2

<div class="example-block">
**Input:** s = "abc", k = 2

**Output:** false

**Explanation:**

There is no substring of length 2 that consists of one distinct character and satisfies the conditions.

</div>

### 4. Constraints

- $1 \le k \le \text{s.length} \le 100$

- `s` consists of lowercase English letters only.
