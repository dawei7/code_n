## Description

You are given two integer arrays `nums` and `threshold`, both of length `n`.

Starting at `step = 1`, you perform the following repeatedly:

	- Choose an **unused** index `i` such that `threshold[i] <= step`.

		<li>If no such index exists, the process ends.

	</li>
	- Add `nums[i]` to your running total.

	- Mark index `i` as used and increment `step` by 1.

Return the **maximum** **total sum** you can obtain by choosing indices optimally.

**Example 1:**

<div class="example-block">
**Input:** <span class="example-io">nums = [1,10,4,2,1,6], threshold = [5,1,5,5,2,2]</span>

**Output:** <span class="example-io">17</span>

**Explanation:**

	- At `step = 1`, choose `i = 1` since `threshold[1] <= step`. The total sum becomes 10. Mark index 1.

	- At `step = 2`, choose `i = 4` since `threshold[4] <= step`. The total sum becomes 11. Mark index 4.

	- At `step = 3`, choose `i = 5` since `threshold[5] <= step`. The total sum becomes 17. Mark index 5.

	- At `step = 4`, we cannot choose indices 0, 2, or 3 because their thresholds are `> 4`, so we end the process.

</div>

**Example 2:**

<div class="example-block">
**Input:** <span class="example-io">nums = [4,1,5,2,3], threshold = [3,3,2,3,3]</span>

**Output:** <span class="example-io">0</span>

**Explanation:**

At `step = 1` there is no index `i` with `threshold[i] <= 1`, so the process ends immediately. Thus, the total sum is 0.

</div>

**Example 3:**

<div class="example-block">
**Input:** <span class="example-io">nums = [2,6,10,13], threshold = [2,1,1,1]</span>

**Output:** <span class="example-io">31</span>

**Explanation:**

	- At `step = 1`, choose `i = 3` since `threshold[3] <= step`. The total sum becomes 13. Mark index 3.

	- At `step = 2`, choose `i = 2` since `threshold[2] <= step`. The total sum becomes 23. Mark index 2.

	- At `step = 3`, choose `i = 1` since `threshold[1] <= step`. The total sum becomes 29. Mark index 1.

	- At `step = 4`, choose `i = 0` since `threshold[0] <= step`. The total sum becomes 31. Mark index 0.

	- After `step = 4` all indices have been chosen, so the process ends.

</div>

**Constraints:**

	- `n == nums.length == threshold.length`

	- `1 <= n <= 10^5`

	- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

	- `1 <= threshold[i] <= n`
