## Description

You are given an `m x n` matrix `grid` of positive integers. Your task is to determine if it is possible to make **either one horizontal or one vertical cut** on the grid such that:

<ul>
	<li>Each of the two resulting sections formed by the cut is **non-empty**.</li>
	<li>The sum of elements in both sections is **equal**, or can be made equal by discounting **at most** one single cell in total (from either section).</li>
	<li>If a cell is discounted, the rest of the section must **remain connected**.</li>
</ul>

Return `true` if such a partition exists; otherwise, return `false`.

**Note:** A section is **connected** if every cell in it can be reached from any other cell by moving up, down, left, or right through other cells in the section.
