## General
Given an integer `k` and an integer `x`. The price of a number `num` is calculated by the count of set bits at positions `x`, `2x`, `3x`, etc., in its binary representation, starting from the least significant bit. The foll..., the algorithm executes a two-pointer approach to shrink boundaries or maintain a sliding window. It utilizes a hash map (`dict`) to store element values and their indices/frequencies for $O(1)$ fast access. Key operations include bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`) for fast bitmask state updates. Edge case handling: applies modulo arithmetic to prevent integer overflow.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(log^2 K)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
