## Description

You are given a 2D integer array `grid` of size `m * n`.

You start at the **top-left** cell `(0, 0)` and want to reach the **bottom-right** cell `(m - 1, n - 1)`.

At each step, you **may** move either **right or down**.

The **cost** of a path is defined as the **bitwise XOR** of all the values in the cells along that path, **including** the start and end cells.

Return the **minimum** possible XOR value among all valid paths from `(0, 0)` to `(m - 1, n - 1)`.
