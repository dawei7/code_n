## Description

Given an integer array `nums`, return *the value of the bitwise ***OR*** of the sum of all possible **subsequences** in the array*.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by removing zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
### Function Contract

- Refer to method signature.

### Examples

#### Example 1

- **Input:** `nums = [2,1,0,3]`
- **Output:** `7`
- **Explanation:** All possible subsequence sums that we can have are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
And we have 0 OR 1 OR 2 OR 3 OR 4 OR 5 OR 6 = 7, so we return 7.
#### Example 2

- **Input:** `nums = [0,0,0]`
- **Output:** `0`
- **Explanation:** 0 is the only possible subsequence sum we can have, so we return 0.
### Constraints

- $1 \le \text{nums.length} \le 10^{5}$

- $0 \le \text{nums}[i] \le 10^{9}$
