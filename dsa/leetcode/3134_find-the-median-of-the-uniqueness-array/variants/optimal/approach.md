## General
Given an integer array `nums`. The **uniqueness array** of `nums` is the sorted array that contains the number of distinct elements of all the subarrays of `nums`. In other words, it is a sorted array consisting of `distinc..., the algorithm executes a single-pass linear scan through input elements. It utilizes a hash map (`dict`) to store element values and their indices/frequencies for $O(1)$ fast access.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n log D)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(D)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
