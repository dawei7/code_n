### Overview

The primary challenge in this problem is to find a proper data structure and an efficient algorithm to maintain all valid events, including **querying** potentially conflicting existing events and **inserting** new valid events.

In this solution article, we first start with a straightforward idea of brute force to warm up, then one step forward, we improve the naive approach to keep all existing events in sorted order and reduce the time complexity.

### Approach #1: Brute Force

**Intuition**

When booking a new event `[start, end)`, check if every current event conflicts with the new event. If none of them do, we can book the event.

**Algorithm**

We will maintain a list of interval *events* (not necessarily sorted). Evidently, two events `[s1, e1)` and `[s2, e2)` do *not* conflict if and only if one of them starts after the other one ends: either $e1 \le s2$ OR $e2 \le s1$. By De Morgan's laws, this means the events conflict when `s1 < e2` AND `s2 < e1`.

**Implementation**

```python
class MyCalendar:

    def __init__(self):
        self.calendar = []

    def book(self, start, end):
        for s, e in self.calendar:
            if s < end and start < e:
                return False
        self.calendar.append((start, end))
        return True
```

**Complexity Analysis**

Let $N$ be the number of events booked.

* Time Complexity: $O(N^2)$. For each new event, we process every previous event to decide whether the new event can be booked. This leads to $\sum_k^N$\mathcal{O}(k)$= O(N^2)$ complexity.

* Space Complexity: $O(N)$, the size of the `calendar`.

### Approach #2: Sorted List + Binary Search

**Intuition**

If we maintained our events in *sorted* order, we could check whether an event could be booked in $O(\log N)$ time (where $N$ is the number of events already booked) by binary searching for where the event should be placed. We would also have to insert the event in our sorted structure.

**Algorithm**

1. Initialize with an empty sorted list data structure `calendar`.
2. For every new interval`[start, end)` in `book()` invokation, we check if there is a conflict on each side with neighboring intervals.
1. Lookup the first index `idx`, which maps to an element `[s1,e1)` in `calendar` and `s > start`, and this step can be conducted by binary search (see [this explore card](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/binary-search/)) as we keep `calendar` in sorted order by starting points of intervals. (Notice that there may not be such an `idx` because `start` >= all kept intervals. In this case, we don't need to check the following step)
2. Check if `end > s1`. If yes, `[start, end)` and `[s1,e1)` must be overlapped, `[start, end)` is illegal, and we should return false for the invokation now.
3. Roll back to the index `idx-1`, which maps to an element `[s2,e2)` in `calendar` and `s1` is the largest staring points that satisfy $s1 \le start$. (Similarly, notice that there may be no element at `idx-1` because `idx` is the 0-th index. In this case, we don't need to check the following step either)
4. Check if `e2 > start`. If yes, `[s2,e2)` and `[start, end)` must be overlapped, `[start, end)` is illegal, and we should return false for the invokation now.
5. If `[start, end)` passes all checkings above, we insert this valid interval at `idx` in `calendar`.

**Implementation**

We need a data structure that keeps elements sorted and supports fast insertion.
- In Java, a [`TreeMap`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/TreeMap.html) is the perfect candidate.
- In C++, we can use `set` container and [$\text{lower}_{bound}$ method](https://cplusplus.com/reference/set/set/lower_bound/).
- In Python, we can keep a [`SortedList`](https://grantjenks.com/docs/sortedcontainers/sortedlist.html).

```python
from sortedcontainers import SortedList

class MyCalendar:
    def __init__(self):
        self.calendar = SortedList()

    def book(self, start: int, end: int) -> bool:
        idx = self.calendar.bisect_right((start, end))
        if (idx > 0 and self.calendar[idx-1][1] > start) or (idx < len(self.calendar) and self.calendar[idx][0] < end):
            return False
        self.calendar.add((start, end))
        return True
```

**Complexity Analysis**

Like Approach 1, let $N$ be the number of events booked.

* Time Complexity: $O(N \log N)$. For each new event, we search that the event is legal in $O(\log N)$ time, then insert it in $O(\log N)$ time.

* Space Complexity: $O(N)$, the size of the data structures used.

> Note: In practice, for Python, if you use `bisect.insort()` or `list.insert()` to add new events to a built-in list as `calendar`, it will result in a time complexity as $O(N)$ instead of $O(\log N)$ for each insertion operation (see [the docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.insort)). However, due to the built-in instruction optimization in `list.insert()` and the constraint of $N \le 1000$ in this problem, this $O(N^2)$ solution may somehow show a better performance in runtime. But we won't provide this solution code here because the time complexity matters.
