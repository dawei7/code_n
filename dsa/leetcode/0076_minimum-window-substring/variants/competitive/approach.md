## General
Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return *the **minimum window*** ***substring**** of *`s`* such that every character in *`t`* (**including duplicates**) is included in the window*. If there..., the algorithm executes a two-pointer approach to shrink boundaries or maintain a sliding window. It utilizes a hash map (`dict`) to store element values and their indices/frequencies for $O(1)$ fast access.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(|s| + |t|)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(|alphabet|)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
