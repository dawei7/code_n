### 1. Description

There are `n` tasks assigned to you. The task times are represented as an integer array `tasks` of length `n`, where the $$i^{\text{th}}$$ task takes $\text{tasks}[i]$ hours to finish. A **work session** is when you work for **at most** `sessionTime` consecutive hours and then take a break.

You should finish the given tasks in a way that satisfies the following conditions:

- If you start a task in a work session, you must complete it in the **same** work session.

- You can start a new task **immediately** after finishing the previous one.

- You may complete the tasks in **any order**.

Given `tasks` and `sessionTime`, return *the **minimum** number of **work sessions** needed to finish all the tasks following the conditions above.*

The tests are generated such that `sessionTime` is **greater** than or **equal** to the **maximum** element in $\text{tasks}[i]$.

### 2. Function Contract

- `n`: Input parameter.
- Returns expected result.

### 3. Examples

#### Example 1

- **Input:** $tasks = [1,2,3], sessionTime = 3$
- **Output:** `2`
- **Explanation:** You can finish the tasks in two work sessions.
- First work session: finish the first and the second tasks in 1 + 2 = 3 hours.
- Second work session: finish the third task in 3 hours.
#### Example 2

- **Input:** $tasks = [3,1,3,1,1], sessionTime = 8$
- **Output:** `2`
- **Explanation:** You can finish the tasks in two work sessions.
- First work session: finish all the tasks except the last one in 3 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 8 hours.
- Second work session: finish the last task in 1 hour.
#### Example 3

- **Input:** $tasks = [1,2,3,4,5], sessionTime = 15$
- **Output:** `1`
- **Explanation:** You can finish all the tasks in one work session.

### 4. Constraints

- $n = \text{tasks.length}$

- $1 \le n \le 14$

- $1 \le \text{tasks}[i] \le 10$

- $max(\text{tasks}[i]) \le sessionTime \le 15$
