## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`.

An element at index `i` is called **dominant** if: `nums[i] > average(nums[i + 1], nums[i + 2], ..., nums[n - 1])`

Your task is to count the number of indices `i` that are **dominant**.

The **average** of a set of numbers is the value obtained by adding all the numbers together and dividing the sum by the total number of numbers.

**Note**: The **rightmost** element of any array is **not** **dominant**.
