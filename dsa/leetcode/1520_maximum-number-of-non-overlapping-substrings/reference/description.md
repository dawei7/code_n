## Description

Given a string `s` of lowercase letters, you need to find the maximum number of **non-empty** substrings of `s` that meet the following conditions:

<ol>
	<li>The substrings do not overlap, that is for any two substrings `s[i..j]` and `s[x..y]`, either `j < x` or `i > y` is true.</li>
	<li>A substring that contains a certain character `c` must also contain all occurrences of `c`.</li>
</ol>

Find *the maximum number of substrings that meet the above conditions*. If there are multiple solutions with the same number of substrings, *return the one with minimum total length. *It can be shown that there exists a unique solution of minimum total length.

Notice that you can return the substrings in **any** order.
