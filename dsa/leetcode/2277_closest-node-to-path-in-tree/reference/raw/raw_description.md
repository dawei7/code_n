## Description

You are given a positive integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a tree, numbered from `0` to `n - 1` (**inclusive**). You are also given a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where `edges[i] = [node1_i, node2_i]` denotes that there is a **bidirectional** edge connecting `node1_i` and `node2_i` in the tree.

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `query` of length `m` where `query[i] = [start_i, end_i, node_i]` means that for the `i^th` query, you are tasked with finding the node on the path from `start_i` to `end_i` that is **closest** to `node_i`.

Return *an integer array *`answer`* of length *`m`*, where *`answer[i]`* is the answer to the *`i^th`* query*.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,4],[2,5],[2,6]], query = [[5,3,4],[5,3,6]]
**Output:** [0,2]
**Explanation:**
The path from node 5 to node 3 consists of the nodes 5, 2, 0, and 3.
The distance between node 4 and node 0 is 2.
Node 0 is the node on the path closest to node 4, so the answer to the first query is 0.
The distance between node 6 and node 2 is 1.
Node 2 is the node on the path closest to node 6, so the answer to the second query is 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2]], query = [[0,1,2]]
**Output:** [1]
**Explanation:**
The path from node 0 to node 1 consists of the nodes 0, 1.
The distance between node 2 and node 1 is 1.
Node 1 is the node on the path closest to node 2, so the answer to the first query is 1.
```

**Example 3:**

![](images/image-20220514132333-3.png)

```
**Input:** n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2]], query = [[0,0,0]]
**Output:** [0]
**Explanation:**
The path from node 0 to node 0 consists of the node 0.
Since 0 is the only node on the path, the answer to the first query is 0.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n <= 1000`

	- `edges.length == n - 1`

	- `edges[i].length == 2`

	- `0 <= node1_i, node2_i <= n - 1`

	- `node1_i != node2_i`

	- `1 <= query.length <= 1000`

	- `query[i].length == 3`

	- `0 <= start_i, end_i, node_i <= n - 1`

	- The graph is a tree.
