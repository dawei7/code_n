## Description

You are given an integer array `prices` where $\text{prices}[i]$ is the price of a stock in dollars on the $$i^{\text{th}}$$ day, and an integer `k`.

You are allowed to make at most `k` transactions, where each transaction can be either of the following:

- **Normal transaction**: Buy on day `i`, then sell on a later day `j` where `i < j`. You profit $\text{prices}[j] - \text{prices}[i]$.

- **Short selling transaction**: Sell on day `i`, then buy back on a later day `j` where `i < j`. You profit $\text{prices}[i] - \text{prices}[j]$.

**Note** that you must complete each transaction before starting another. Additionally, you can't buy or sell on the same day you are selling or buying back as part of a previous transaction.

Return the **maximum** total profit you can earn by making **at most** `k` transactions.
### Function Contract

- `n`: Input parameter.
- Returns expected result.

### Examples
#### Example 1

<div class="example-block">
**Input:** prices = [1,7,9,8,2], k = 2

**Output:** 14

**Explanation:**

We can make $14 of profit through 2 transactions:

- A normal transaction: buy the stock on day 0 for $1 then sell it on day 2 for$9.

- A short selling transaction: sell the stock on day 3 for $8 then buy back on day 4 for$2.

</div>
#### Example 2

<div class="example-block">
**Input:** prices = [12,16,19,19,8,1,19,13,9], k = 3

- A normal transaction: buy the stock on day 0 for $12 then sell it on day 2 for$19.

- A short selling transaction: sell the stock on day 3 for $19 then buy back on day 4 for$8.

</div>
### Constraints

- $2 \le \text{prices.length} \le 10^{3}$

- $1 \le \text{prices}[i] \le 10^{9}$

- $1 \le k \le \text{prices.length} / 2$
