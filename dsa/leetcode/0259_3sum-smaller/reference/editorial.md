### Approach 1: Brute Force

**Intuition**

Find every possible set of triplets $(i, j, k)$ such that $i < j < k$ and test for the condition.

**Complexity analysis**

- Time complexity: $O(n^3)$.
  The total number of such triplets is $\binom{n}{3}$, which is $\frac{n!}{(n - 3)! \times 3!} = \frac{n \times (n - 1) \times (n - 2)}{6}$. Therefore, the time complexity of the brute force approach is $O(n^3)$.

- Space complexity: $O(1)$.

### Approach 2: Binary Search

**Intuition**

Before we solve the _threeSum_ problem, solve this simpler _twoSum_ version:

> Given a $nums$ array, find the number of index pairs $i$, $j$ with $0 \leq i < j < n$ that satisfy the condition $\text{nums}[i] + \text{nums}[j] < target$

If we sort the array first, then we can apply binary search to find the largest index $j$ such that $\text{nums}[i] + \text{nums}[j] < target$ for each $i$. Once we have found that largest index $j$, we know there must be $j-i$ pairs that satisfy the above condition with $i$'s value fixed.

Finally, we can now apply the _twoSum_ solution to _threeSum_ directly by wrapping an outer for-loop around it.

**Implementation**

```java
class Solution {
    public int threeSumSmaller(int[] nums, int target) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 2; i++) {
            sum += twoSumSmaller(nums, i + 1, target - nums[i]);
        }
        return sum;
    }

    private int twoSumSmaller(int[] nums, int startIndex, int target) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = startIndex; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
            int j = binarySearch(nums, i, target - nums[i]);
            sum += j - i;
        }
        return sum;
    }

    private int binarySearch(int[] nums, int startIndex, int target) {
        int left = startIndex;
        int right = nums.length - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = (left + right + 1) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] < target) {
                left = mid;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }
}
```

Note that in the above binary search we choose the upper middle element $(\frac{left+right+1}{2})$ instead of the lower middle element $(\frac{left+right}{2})$. The reason is due to the terminating condition when there are two elements left. If we chose the lower middle element and the condition $\text{nums}[mid] < target$ evaluates to true, then the loop would never terminate. Choosing the upper middle element will guarantee termination.

**Complexity analysis**

- Time complexity: $O(n^2 \log n)$.
  The _binarySearch_ function takes $O(\log n)$ time, therefore the _twoSumSmaller_ takes $O(n \log n)$ time. The _threeSumSmaller_ wraps with another for-loop, and therefore is $O(n^2 \log n)$ time.

- Space complexity: $O(1)$ because no additional data structures are used.

### Approach 3: Two Pointers

**Intuition**

Let us try sorting the array first. For example, $nums = [3,5,2,8,1]$ becomes $[1,2,3,5,8]$.

Let us look at an example $nums = [1,2,3,5,8]$, and $target = 7$.

    [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
     ↑           ↑
    left       right

Let us initialize two indices, $left$ and $right$ pointing to the first and last element respectively.

When we look at the sum of first and last element, it is $1 + 8 = 9$, which is $\geq target$. That tells us no index pair will ever contain the index $right$. So the next logical step is to move the right pointer one step to its left.

    [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
     ↑        ↑
    left    right

Now the pair sum is $1 + 5 = 6$, which is less than $target$. How many pairs with one of the $index = left$ that satisfy the condition? You can tell by the difference between $right$ and $left$ which is $3$, namely $(1,2), (1,3),$ and $(1,5)$. Therefore, we move $left$ one step to its right.

**Implementation**

```java
class Solution {
    public int threeSumSmaller(int[] nums, int target) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 2; i++) {
            sum += twoSumSmaller(nums, i + 1, target - nums[i]);
        }
        return sum;
    }

    private int twoSumSmaller(int[] nums, int startIndex, int target) {
        int sum = 0;
        int left = startIndex;
        int right = nums.length - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            if (nums[left] + nums[right] < target) {
                sum += right - left;
                left++;
            } else {
                right--;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

**Complexity analysis**

- Time complexity: $O(n^2)$.
  _twoSumSmaller_ takes $O(n)$ at most since it touches each element in the array once. It's parent function, _threeSumSmaller_ takes $O(n\log n)$ to sort the array, then runs a loop that touches $(n - 2)$ elements, invoking _twoSumSmaller_ at each iteration. Therefore, the overall time complexity is $O(n\log n + n^2)$, which boils down to $O(n^2)$.

- Space complexity: $O(1)$ because no additional data structures are used.
