### Approach: Two Pointers

#### Intuition
The first and third conditions state that every consecutive pair of integers should have opposite signs and the resultant array should begin with a positive integer. Hence, the `0th` index shall contain a positive integer, the `1st` index shall contain a negative integer, and so on. From these conditions, we can say that all even indices of the result should have positive integers and all odd indices should have negative integers. This suggests we can use two pointers to track the even and odd indices of the resultant array `ans`.
Let us now consider the second condition, which states that all integers of the same sign should be in the same order as they were in the original array `nums`. If we were to iterate over `nums` in order and populate our `ans` array using the two pointers based on the sign of the current integer, the order of the integers of the same sign would be maintained. Therefore, we can satisfy all the conditions in one pass! Note that since every other index will be odd and every other index will be even, both pointers would increment by 2 rather than 1.

#### Algorithm
Let us label the two pointers to track even and odd indices as `posIndex` and `negIndex` respectively. These pointers shall be initialized with 0 for `posIndex` and 1 for `negIndex`. These indices will traverse the `ans` array which will be initialized with the same size as `nums`.
Now, we'll start traversing `nums` from the `0th` index. Recall that traversing `nums` from the start will ensure that the order is maintained in our `ans` array. If a positive integer is encountered in `nums`, we'll set it in $\text{ans}[posIndex]$. Since the next positive integer should be placed in $posIndex + 2$, we'll increment `posIndex` accordingly. This process will be the same for any negative integer and `negIndex`. Since it is given that there are equal numbers of positive and negative integers, we don't stand the risk of going out of bounds with either of the two indices.

Let us summarize the algorithm.

1. Initialize `n` to the size of `nums`. Initialize `ans` array of size `n`.
2. Initialize two integers `posIndex` and `negIndex` with 0 and 1 respectively.
3. Traverse `nums` from the start. Note that `0` won't be in the array according to the constraints.

   i. If the current integer is positive, set $\text{ans}[posIndex]$ equal to it. Increment `posIndex` by 2.

   ii. If the current integer is negative, set $\text{ans}[negIndex]$ equal to it. Increment `negIndex` by 2.

4. Once `nums` is fully traversed, return `ans`.

#### Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def rearrangeArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)

        # Initializing an answer array of size n
        ans = [0] * n

        # Initializing two pointers to track even and
        # odd indices for positive and negative integers respectively
        pos_index, neg_index = 0, 1

        for i in range(n):
            if nums[i] > 0:
                # Placing the positive integer at the
                # desired index in ans and incrementing pos_index by 2
                ans[pos_index] = nums[i]
                pos_index += 2
            else:
                # Placing the negative integer at the
                # desired index in ans and incrementing neg_index by 2
                ans[neg_index] = nums[i]
                neg_index += 2

        return ans
```



#### Complexity Analysis

Let $n$ be the length of `nums`

* Time complexity: $O(n)$
  +  We traverse `nums` once and populate `ans`. Since both these arrays have size $n$, this results in a time complexity of $O(n)$.

* Space complexity: $O(n)$
  + We create an auxiliary array `ans` of size $n$.
