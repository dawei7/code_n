## General
### Beginner-Friendly Intuition & Strategy
The core task in **Correct a Binary Tree** is to You have a binary tree with a small defect. There is **exactly one** invalid node where its right child incorrectly points to another node at the **same depth** but to the **invalid node's right**. Instead of using nested loops that inspect every pair in $O(n^2)$ time, this algorithm uses the **Two-Pointer technique**. We place two markers (pointers)—typically one at the start (`left`) and one at the end (`right`) of a sorted array—and move them toward each other based on clear comparison rules, completing the search in a single efficient pass.

### Step-by-Step Execution Guide
**Step 1: Setup & Initial State**  
We initialize an empty hash set (`set`) to remember elements we have already seen, ensuring we never process duplicate items.  
**Step 2: Core Processing & Decisions**  
1. Inspect the elements at `array[left]` and `array[right]`.  
2. Compute the current metric (e.g. sum or container area).  
3. Compare against our target requirement.  
4. Advance `left += 1` or retreat `right -= 1` depending on whether we need a larger or smaller value.  
**Step 3: Completion & Result Return**  
When processing finishes, the algorithm outputs the final validated solution.

### Why This Handles Edge Cases Gracefully
- **Empty / Null Inputs:** Early guard checks return empty results immediately without crashing.
- **Single Element / Border Cases:** Loop bounds handle single items and empty inputs naturally without array index out-of-bounds exceptions.


## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(N)$ — Detailed Analysis: The time complexity corresponds directly to the total number of operations required by the step-by-step execution loop described above.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(N)$ — Detailed Analysis: The space complexity reflects the auxiliary memory allocated for tracking structures, recursion stack depth, or hash maps during processing.
