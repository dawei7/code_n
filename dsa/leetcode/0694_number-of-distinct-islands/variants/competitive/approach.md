## General
Given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid`. An island is a group of `1`'s (representing land) connected **4-directionally** (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water, the algorithm executes a two-pointer approach to shrink boundaries or maintain a sliding window. It utilizes a hash map (`dict`) to store element values and their indices/frequencies for $O(1)$ fast access, a hash set (`set`) to track unique elements and prevent duplicate processing in $O(1)$ time. Edge case handling: guards against empty/null inputs via early returns.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(RC)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(RC)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
