## General
Given Two strings `word1` and `word2` are considered **almost equivalent** if the differences between the frequencies of each letter from `'a'` to `'z'` between `word1` and `word2` is **at most** `3`, the algorithm executes a single-pass linear scan through input elements. It utilizes a hash map (`dict`) to store element values and their indices/frequencies for $O(1)$ fast access.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
