## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` having length `n` and a 2D integer array `queries` where `queries[i] = [idx, val]`.

For each query:

	- Update `nums[idx] = val`.

	- Choose an integer `k` with `1 <= k < n` to split the array into the non-empty prefix `nums[0..k-1]` and suffix `nums[k..n-1]` such that the sum of the counts of **distinct** <span data-keyword="prime-number">prime</span> values in each part is **maximum**.

**Note:** The changes made to the array in one query persist into the next query.

Return an array containing the result for each query, in the order they are given.

**Example 1:**

<div class="example-block">
**Input:** <span class="example-io">nums = [2,1,3,1,2], queries = [[1,2],[3,3]]</span>

**Output:** <span class="example-io">[3,4]</span>

**Explanation:**

	- Initially `nums = [2, 1, 3, 1, 2]`.

	- After 1^st query, `nums = [2, 2, 3, 1, 2]`. Split `nums` into `[2]` and `[2, 3, 1, 2]`. `[2]` consists of 1 distinct prime and `[2, 3, 1, 2]` consists of 2 distinct primes. Hence, the answer for this query is `1 + 2 = 3`.

	- After 2^nd query, `nums = [2, 2, 3, 3, 2]`. Split `nums` into `[2, 2, 3]` and `[3, 2]` with an answer of `2 + 2 = 4`.

	- The output is `[3, 4]`.

</div>

**Example 2:**

<div class="example-block">
**Input:** <span class="example-io">nums = [2,1,4], queries = [[0,1]]</span>

**Output:** <span class="example-io">[0]</span>

**Explanation:**

	- Initially `nums = [2, 1, 4]`.

	- After 1^st query, `nums = [1, 1, 4]`. There are no prime numbers in `nums`, hence the answer for this query is 0.

	- The output is `[0]`.

</div>

**Constraints:**

	- `2 <= n == nums.length <= 5 * 10^4`

	- `1 <= queries.length <= 5 * 10^4`

	- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

	- `0 <= queries[i][0] < nums.length`

	- `1 <= queries[i][1] <= 10^5`
