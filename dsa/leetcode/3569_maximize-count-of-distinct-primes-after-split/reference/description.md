## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` having length `n` and a 2D integer array `queries` where `queries[i] = [idx, val]`.

For each query:

<ol>
	<li>Update `nums[idx] = val`.</li>
	<li>Choose an integer `k` with `1 <= k < n` to split the array into the non-empty prefix `nums[0..k-1]` and suffix `nums[k..n-1]` such that the sum of the counts of **distinct** <span data-keyword="prime-number">prime</span> values in each part is **maximum**.</li>
</ol>

<strong data-end="513" data-start="504">Note:</strong> The changes made to the array in one query persist into the next query.

Return an array containing the result for each query, in the order they are given.
