## Description

Given a Tic-Tac-Toe board as a string array `board`, return `true` if and only if it is possible to reach this board position during the course of a valid tic-tac-toe game.

The board is a `3 x 3` array that consists of characters `' '`, `'X'`, and `'O'`. The `' '` character represents an empty square.

Here are the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe:

<ul>
	<li>Players take turns placing characters into empty squares `' '`.</li>
	<li>The first player always places `'X'` characters, while the second player always places `'O'` characters.</li>
	<li>`'X'` and `'O'` characters are always placed into empty squares, never filled ones.</li>
	<li>The game ends when there are three of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.</li>
	<li>The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.</li>
	<li>No more moves can be played if the game is over.</li>
</ul>
