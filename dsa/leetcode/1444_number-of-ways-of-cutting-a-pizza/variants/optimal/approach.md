## General
Given a rectangular pizza represented as a `rows x cols` matrix containing the following characters: `'A'` (an apple) and `'.'` (empty cell) and given the integer `k`. You have to cut the pizza into `k` pieces using `k-1` cuts, the algorithm executes depth-first search (DFS) recursion to explore valid decision branches. It utilizes a hash map (`dict`) to store element values and their indices/frequencies for $O(1)$ fast access. Edge case handling: applies modulo arithmetic to prevent integer overflow.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(kmn(m+n))$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(kmn)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
