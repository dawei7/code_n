### Approach: Binary Search + Difference Array

#### Intuition

According to the problem statement, we need to find the maximum possible value of the **minimum power supply**. It is intuitive to use **binary search** to determine the highest possible minimum power supply across all cities. The key is to verify whether a given power level $x$ can satisfy the problem’s requirement; that is, whether it is possible for every city’s power supply to be at least $x$ after adding $k$ additional power stations.

Since the power station in the $i$-th city covers the range $[i - r, i + r]$, we can use a **difference array** to efficiently calculate the total power for each city. The critical part is deciding where to place the $k$ additional power stations, which can be determined using a **greedy strategy**.

Suppose the target minimum power for each city is $x$. We traverse the cities from left to right:

+ If the power at index $i$ is greater than or equal to $x$, we move on to the next city ($i + 1$).

+ If the power at index $i$ is less than $x$, we theoretically need to add power stations within the interval $[i - r, i + r]$. Since we are traversing in order, by the time we reach city $i$, all cities before it already have sufficient power. Therefore, adding power stations to earlier cities would be redundant. To maximize efficiency, we should add power stations to cities *after* $i$. If we add a power station at position $i + r$, it will cover the range $[i, i + 2r]$, thereby benefiting as many cities after $i$ as possible. Hence, the optimal choice is to add a power station at $i + r$.

The actual calculation proceeds as follows:

+ For convenience, precompute the **difference array** `diff` based on the given `stations` array.
  Use binary search to find the maximum value. According to the problem statement, the lower bound of the binary search can start at $\textit{lo} = \min(\textit{stations})$, and the upper bound can be $\textit{hi} = \text{sum}(\textit{stations}) + k$, since no city’s power can exceed this limit. Then, use binary search to test the candidate value $\textit{mid}$.

+ For each binary search iteration, calculate the prefix sum of the difference array from left to right. When traversing to index $i$, if the current sum is less than `mid`, it means the city’s power is insufficient. In that case, we need to add `add = mid - sum` power stations at position `i + r` to ensure that city $i$ reaches at least `mid`. The total power `sum` increases by `add`, and the remaining number of available stations decreases by `add`. Update the difference array accordingly and continue the traversal. If all cities can reach at least `mid` power, we can try increasing `mid`. If the number of remaining power stations becomes insufficient before completing the traversal, it means `mid` is too high, and we must reduce it.

+ The final answer is the maximum value of `mid` that satisfies the condition, found through binary search.

+ The target value of binary search is the answer.

#### Implementation


```python
class Solution:
    def maxPower(self, stations: List[int], r: int, k: int) -> int:
        n = len(stations)
        cnt = [0] * (n + 1)

        for i in range(n):
            left = max(0, i - r)
            right = min(n, i + r + 1)
            cnt[left] += stations[i]
            cnt[right] -= stations[i]

        def check(val: int) -> bool:
            diff = cnt.copy()
            total = 0
            remaining = k

            for i in range(n):
                total += diff[i]
                if total < val:
                    add = val - total
                    if remaining < add:
                        return False
                    remaining -= add
                    end = min(n, i + 2 * r + 1)
                    diff[end] -= add
                    total += add
            return True

        lo, hi = min(stations), sum(stations) + k
        res = 0
        while lo <= hi:
            mid = (lo + hi) // 2
            if check(mid):
                res = mid
                lo = mid + 1
            else:
                hi = mid - 1
        return res
```


#### Complexity Analysis

Let $n$ be the length of the array $\textit{stations}$, $D = \text{sum}(\textit{stations}) + k$.

- Time complexity: $O(n \log D)$.
  
  Computing the difference array takes $O(n)$ time. The binary search runs in $O(\log D)$ iterations, and each iteration takes $O(n)$ time, resulting in a total complexity of $O(n \log D)$.

- Space complexity: $O(n)$.
  
  The space required for calculating the difference array is $O(n)$.
