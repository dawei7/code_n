## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and a binary string `s` of length `n`, where `s[i] == '1'` means index `i` initially contains a **token** and `s[i] == '0'` means it does not.

You may perform the following operation any number of times:

	- Choose a token currently located at index `i`, where `i > 0`, such that this token has **not** been moved before.

	- Move this token from index `i` to index `i - 1`.

An index is considered **covered** if it contains a token after all moves.

Return an integer denoting the **maximum total value** of `nums` at the covered indices after optimally performing the operations.

**Example 1:**

<div class="example-block">
**Input:** <span class="example-io">nums = [9,2,6,1], s = "0101"</span>

**Output:** <span class="example-io">15</span>

**Explanation:**

	- Initially, indices 1 and 3 contain tokens.

	- Move the token from index 3 to index 2.

	- Move the token from index 1 to index 0.

	- The covered indices are `[0, 2]`, so the total value is `nums[0] + nums[2] = 9 + 6 = 15`.

</div>

**Example 2:**

<div class="example-block">
**Input:** <span class="example-io">nums = [5,1,4], s = "001"</span>

**Output:** <span class="example-io">4</span>

**Explanation:**

	- Initially, only index 2 contains a token.

	- It is optimal to leave the token at index 2.

	- The covered index is `[2]`, so the total value is `nums[2] = 4`.

</div>

**Example 3:**

<div class="example-block">
**Input:** <span class="example-io">nums = [9,3,5], s = "011"</span>

**Output:** <span class="example-io">14</span>

**Explanation:**

	- Initially, indices 1 and 2 contain tokens.

	- Move the token from index 1 to index 0.

	- The covered indices are `[0, 2]`, so the total value is `nums[0] + nums[2] = 9 + 5 = 14`.

</div>

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n == nums.length == s.length <= 10^5`

	- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

	- ​​​​​​​`s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`
