## Description

You are given a character array `keys` containing **unique** characters and a string array `values` containing strings of length 2. You are also given another string array `dictionary` that contains all permitted original strings after decryption. You should implement a data structure that can encrypt or decrypt a **0-indexed** string.

A string is **encrypted** with the following process:

<ol>
	<li>For each character `c` in the string, we find the index `i` satisfying `keys[i] == c` in `keys`.</li>
	<li>Replace `c` with `values[i]` in the string.</li>
</ol>

Note that in case a character of the string is **not present** in `keys`, the encryption process cannot be carried out, and an empty string `""` is returned.

A string is **decrypted** with the following process:

<ol>
	<li>For each substring `s` of length 2 occurring at an even index in the string, we find an `i` such that `values[i] == s`. If there are multiple valid `i`, we choose **any** one of them. This means a string could have multiple possible strings it can decrypt to.</li>
	<li>Replace `s` with `keys[i]` in the string.</li>
</ol>

Implement the `Encrypter` class:

<ul>
	<li>`Encrypter(char[] keys, String[] values, String[] dictionary)` Initializes the `Encrypter` class with `keys, values`, and `dictionary`.</li>
	<li>`String encrypt(String word1)` Encrypts `word1` with the encryption process described above and returns the encrypted string.</li>
	<li>`int decrypt(String word2)` Returns the number of possible strings `word2` could decrypt to that also appear in `dictionary`.</li>
</ul>
