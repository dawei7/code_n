## Description

You are given five integers `cost1`, `cost2`, `costBoth`, `need1`, and `need2`.

There are three types of items available:

<ul>
	<li>An item of **type 1** costs `cost1` and contributes 1 unit to the type 1 requirement only.</li>
	<li>An item of **type 2** costs `cost2` and contributes 1 unit to the type 2 requirement only.</li>
	<li>An item of **type 3** costs `costBoth` and contributes 1 unit to **both** type 1 and type 2 requirements.</li>
</ul>

You must collect enough items so that the total contribution toward type 1 is **at least** `need1` and the total contribution toward type 2 is **at least** `need2`.

Return an integer representing the **minimum** possible total cost to achieve these requirements.
