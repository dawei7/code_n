### 1. Description

There are `n` teams numbered from `0` to $n - 1$ in a tournament; each team is also a node in a **DAG**.

You are given the integer `n` and a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `edges` of length `m` representing the **DAG**, where $\text{edges}[i] = [u_{i}, v_{i}]$ indicates that there is a directed edge from team $u_{i}$ to team $v_{i}$ in the graph.

A directed edge from `a` to `b` in the graph means that team `a` is **stronger** than team `b` and team `b` is **weaker** than team `a`.

Team `a` will be the **champion** of the tournament if there is no team `b` that is **stronger** than team `a`.

Return *the team that will be the **champion** of the tournament if there is a **unique** champion, otherwise, return *`-1`*.*

### 2. Function Contract

- `n`: Input parameter.
- Returns expected result.

### 3. Note

- A **cycle** is a series of nodes $a_{1}, a_{2}, ..., a_{n}, a_{n}+1$ such that node $a_{1}$ is the same node as node $a_{n}+1$, the nodes $a_{1}, a_{2}, ..., a_{n}$ are distinct, and there is a directed edge from the node $a_{i}$ to node $a_{i}+1$ for every `i` in the range `[1, n]`.

- A **DAG** is a directed graph that does not have any **cycle**.

### 4. Examples

#### Example 1

![](images/graph-3.png)

- **Input:** $n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2]]$
- **Output:** `0`
- **Explanation:** Team 1 is weaker than team 0. Team 2 is weaker than team 1. So the champion is team 0.
#### Example 2

![](images/graph-4.png)

- **Input:** $n = 4, edges = [[0,2],[1,3],[1,2]]$
- **Output:** `-1`
- **Explanation:** Team 2 is weaker than team 0 and team 1. Team 3 is weaker than team 1. But team 1 and team 0 are not weaker than any other teams. So the answer is -1.

### 5. Constraints

- $1 \le n \le 100$

- $m = \text{edges.length}$

- $0 \le m \le n * (n - 1) / 2$

- $\text{edges}[i].length = 2$

- $0 \le \text{edge}[i][j] \le n - 1$

- $\text{edges}[i][0] \neq \text{edges}[i][1]$

- The input is generated such that if team `a` is stronger than team `b`, team `b` is not stronger than team `a`.

- The input is generated such that if team `a` is stronger than team `b` and team `b` is stronger than team `c`, then team `a` is stronger than team `c`.
