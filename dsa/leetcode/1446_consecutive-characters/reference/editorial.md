### Overview

This problem is very similar to [674. Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-continuous-increasing-subsequence/), and the only difference is that we need a substring with the same characters instead of an increasing one. Therefore, similar methods can be applied. Below, a similar and simple approach is introduced.

### Approach #1: One Pass

**Intuition and Algorithm**

Recall the problem, we need to find "the maximum length of a non-empty substring that contains only one unique character".

In other words, we need to find the Longest Substring with **the same characters**.

We can iterate over the given string, and use a variable `count` to record the length of that substring.

When the next character is the same as the previous one, we increase `count` by one. Else, we reset `count` to 1.

With this method, when reaching the end of a substring with the same characters, `count` will be the length of that substring, since we reset the `count` when that substring starts, and increase `count` when iterate that substring.

Therefore, the maximum value of `count` is what we need. Another variable is needed to store the maximum while iterating.

```python
class Solution:
    def maxPower(self, s: str) -> int:
        count = 0
        max_count = 0
        previous = None
        for c in s:
            if c == previous:
                # if same as previous one, increase the count
                count += 1
            else:
                # else, reset the count
                previous = c
                count = 1
            max_count = max(max_count, count)
        return max_count
```

**Complexity Analysis**

Let $N$ be the length of `s`.

* Time Complexity: $O(N)$, since we perform one loop through `s`.

* Space Complexity: $O(1)$, since we only have two integer variables `count` and $\text{max}_{count}$(`maxCount`), and one character variable `previous`.
