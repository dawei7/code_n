## General
Given An undirected graph of `n` nodes is defined by `edgeList`, where $\text{edgeList}[i] = [u_{i}, v_{i}, \text{dis}_{i}]$ denotes an edge between nodes $u_{i}$ and $v_{i}$ with distance $\text{dis}_{i}$. Note that there ..., the algorithm executes a single-pass linear scan through input elements. It utilizes a hash map (`dict`) to store element values and their indices/frequencies for $O(1)$ fast access.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O((E+Q)log(E+Q))$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(n+E+Q)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
