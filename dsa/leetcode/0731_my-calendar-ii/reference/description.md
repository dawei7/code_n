## Description

You are implementing a program to use as your calendar. We can add a new event if adding the event will not cause a **triple booking**.

A **triple booking** happens when three events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to all the three events.).

The event can be represented as a pair of integers `startTime` and `endTime` that represents a booking on the half-open interval `[startTime, endTime)`, the range of real numbers `x` such that `startTime <= x < endTime`.

Implement the `MyCalendarTwo` class:

<ul>
	<li>`MyCalendarTwo()` Initializes the calendar object.</li>
	<li>`boolean book(int startTime, int endTime)` Returns `true` if the event can be added to the calendar successfully without causing a **triple booking**. Otherwise, return `false` and do not add the event to the calendar.</li>
</ul>
