## General
### Beginner-Friendly Intuition & Strategy
The core task in **Grid Teleportation Traversal** is to a 2D character grid `matrix` of size `m x n`, represented as an array of strings, where $\text{matrix}[i][j]$ represents the cell at the intersection of the $$i^{\text{th}}$$ row and $$j^{\text{th}}$$ column. Each cell is one of the following:. The algorithm processes the input using a single-pass linear iteration, maintaining state variables that update as each element is inspected to produce the result cleanly.

### Step-by-Step Execution Guide
**Step 1: Setup & Initial State**  
We initialize a double-ended queue (`collections.deque`) to keep track of active window bounds or nodes waiting to be processed in order.  
**Step 2: Core Processing & Decisions**  
1. Iterate sequentially through each element in the input.  
2. Apply the operational rules to update running state variables.  
3. Continue until all elements are evaluated.  
**Step 3: Completion & Result Return**  
When processing finishes, the algorithm outputs the final validated solution.

### Why This Handles Edge Cases Gracefully
- **Empty / Null Inputs:** Early guard checks return empty results immediately without crashing.
- **Single Element / Border Cases:** Loop bounds handle single items and empty inputs naturally without array index out-of-bounds exceptions.


## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(mn)$ — Detailed Analysis: The time complexity corresponds directly to the total number of operations required by the step-by-step execution loop described above.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(mn)$ — Detailed Analysis: The space complexity reflects the auxiliary memory allocated for tracking structures, recursion stack depth, or hash maps during processing.
