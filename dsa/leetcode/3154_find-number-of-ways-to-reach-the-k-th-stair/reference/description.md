## Description

You are given a **non-negative** integer `k`. There exists a staircase with an infinite number of stairs, with the **lowest** stair numbered 0.

Alice has an integer `jump`, with an initial value of 0. She starts on stair 1 and wants to reach stair `k` using **any** number of **operations**. If she is on stair `i`, in one **operation** she can:

- Go down to stair $i - 1$. This operation **cannot** be used consecutively or on stair 0.

- Go up to stair $i + 2^jump$. And then, `jump` becomes $jump + 1$.

Return the *total* number of ways Alice can reach stair `k`.

**Note** that it is possible that Alice reaches the stair `k`, and performs some operations to reach the stair `k` again.
### Function Contract

- `n`: Input parameter.
- Returns expected result.

### Examples

#### Example 1

<div class="example-block">
**Input:** k = 0

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

The 2 possible ways of reaching stair 0 are:

- Alice starts at stair 1.

		<li>Using an operation of the first type, she goes down 1 stair to reach stair 0.

	</li>
- Alice starts at stair 1.

		<li>Using an operation of the first type, she goes down 1 stair to reach stair 0.

- Using an operation of the second type, she goes up $2^{0}$ stairs to reach stair 1.

- Using an operation of the first type, she goes down 1 stair to reach stair 0.

	</li>

</div>
#### Example 2

<div class="example-block">
**Input:** k = 1

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

The 4 possible ways of reaching stair 1 are:

- Alice starts at stair 1. Alice is at stair 1.

- Alice starts at stair 1.

		<li>Using an operation of the first type, she goes down 1 stair to reach stair 0.

- Using an operation of the second type, she goes up $2^{0}$ stairs to reach stair 1.

	</li>
- Alice starts at stair 1.

		<li>Using an operation of the second type, she goes up $2^{0}$ stairs to reach stair 2.

- Using an operation of the first type, she goes down 1 stair to reach stair 1.

	</li>
- Alice starts at stair 1.

		<li>Using an operation of the first type, she goes down 1 stair to reach stair 0.

- Using an operation of the second type, she goes up $2^{0}$ stairs to reach stair 1.

- Using an operation of the first type, she goes down 1 stair to reach stair 0.

- Using an operation of the second type, she goes up $2^{1}$ stairs to reach stair 2.

- Using an operation of the first type, she goes down 1 stair to reach stair 1.

	</li>

</div>
### Constraints

- $0 \le k \le 10^{9}$
