## General
Given There is a donuts shop that bakes donuts in batches of `batchSize`. They have a rule where they must serve **all** of the donuts of a batch before serving any donuts of the next batch. You are given an integer `batchS..., the algorithm executes a single-pass linear scan through input elements. It utilizes a dynamic programming memoization table to cache intermediate subproblem states. Key operations include bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`) for fast bitmask state updates. Edge case handling: applies modulo arithmetic to prevent integer overflow.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(bS)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(S)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
