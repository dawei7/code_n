### Overview

The value we're asked to compute is the so-called [Digital Root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_root). Logarithmic time solution is easy to write, although the main question here is how to fit into a constant time.

```python
class Solution:
    def addDigits(self, num: int) -> int:
        digital_root = 0
        while num > 0:
            digital_root += num % 10
            num = num // 10

            if num == 0 and digital_root > 9:
                num = digital_root
                digital_root = 0

        return digital_root
```

### Approach 1: Mathematical: Digital Root

**Formula for the Digital Root**

There is a known formula to compute a digital root in a decimal numeral system

$dr_{10}(n) = 0, \qquad \text{if } n = 0$

$dr_{10}(n) = 9, \qquad \text{if } n = 9 k$

$dr_{10}(n) = n \mod 9, \qquad \text{if } n \neq 9 k$

How to derive it? Probably, you already know the following proof from school, where it was used for divisibility by 9: "The original number is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9". Let's revise it briefly.

The input number could be presented in a standard way, where $d_0, d_1, .. d_k$ are digits of n:

$n = d_0 + d_1 \cdot $10^{1}$ + d_2 \cdot $10^{2}$ + ... + d_k \cdot 10^k$

One could expand each power of ten, using the following:

$$
10 = 9 \cdot 1 + 1 \\
100 = 99 + 1 = 9 \cdot 11 + 1 \\
1000 = 999 + 1 = 9 \cdot 111 + 1 \\
... \\
10^k = 1\underbrace{00..0}_\text{k times} = \underbrace{99..9}_\text{k times} + 1 = 9 \cdot \underbrace{11..1}_\text{k times} + 1
$That results in$
n = d_0 + d_1 \cdot (9 \cdot 1 + 1) + d_2 \cdot(9 \cdot 11 + 1) + ... + d_k \cdot (9 \cdot \underbrace{11..1}_\text{k times} + 1)
$and could be simplified as$
n = (d_0 + d_1 + d_2 + ... + d_k) + 9 \cdot (d_1 \cdot 1 + d_2 \cdot 11 + ... + d_k \cdot \underbrace{11..1}_\text{k times})
$The last step is to take the modulo from both sides:$
n \mod 9 = (d_0 + d_1 + d_2 + ... + d_k) \mod 9
$and to consider separately three cases: the sum of digits is 0, the sum of digits is divisible by 9, and the sum of digits is _not_ divisible by nine:$
dr_{10}(n) = 0, \qquad \text{if } n = 0
$$

$dr_{10}(n) = 9, \qquad \text{if } n = 9 k$

$dr_{10}(n) = n \mod 9, \qquad \text{if } n \neq 9 k$

**Implementation**

The straightforward implementation is

```python
class Solution:
    def addDigits(self, num: int) -> int:
        if num == 0:
            return 0
        if num % 9 == 0:
            return 9
        return num % 9
```

though two last cases could be merged into one

$dr_{10}(n) = 0, \qquad \text{if } n = 0$

$dr_{10}(n) = 1 + (n - 1) \mod 9, \qquad \text{if } n \neq 0$

```python
class Solution:
    def addDigits(self, num: int) -> int:
        return 1 + (num - 1) % 9 if num else 0
```

#### Complexity Analysis

Let $n$ be the input number.

- Time complexity: $O(1)$

    The function performs a constant number of operations, regardless of the input size. The operations involve simple arithmetic calculations and a conditional check, all of which take constant time.

- Space complexity: $O(1)$

    The function uses a constant amount of extra space. It does not depend on the input size and only uses a few variables for the calculations, which do not grow with the input.
