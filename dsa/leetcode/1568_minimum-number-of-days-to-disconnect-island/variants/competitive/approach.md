## General
Given an `m x n` binary grid `grid` where `1` represents land and `0` represents water. An **island** is a maximal **4-directionally** (horizontal or vertical) connected group of `1`'s, the algorithm executes binary search over the search space to achieve logarithmic reduction. It utilizes a hash map (`dict`) to store element values and their indices/frequencies for $O(1)$ fast access, a hash set (`set`) to track unique elements and prevent duplicate processing in $O(1)$ time. Key operations include bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`) for fast bitmask state updates. Edge case handling: guards against empty/null inputs via early returns, applies modulo arithmetic to prevent integer overflow.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(RC)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(RC)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
