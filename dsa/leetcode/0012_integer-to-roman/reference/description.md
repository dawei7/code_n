## Description

Seven different symbols represent Roman numerals with the following values:

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Symbol</th>
			<th>Value</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>I</td>
			<td>1</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>V</td>
			<td>5</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>X</td>
			<td>10</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>L</td>
			<td>50</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>C</td>
			<td>100</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>D</td>
			<td>500</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>M</td>
			<td>1000</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

Roman numerals are formed by appending the conversions of decimal place values from highest to lowest. Converting a decimal place value into a Roman numeral has the following rules:

<ul>
	<li>If the value does not start with 4 or 9, select the symbol of the maximal value that can be subtracted from the input, append that symbol to the result, subtract its value, and convert the remainder to a Roman numeral.</li>
	<li>If the value starts with 4 or 9 use the **subtractive form** representing one symbol subtracted from the following symbol, for example, 4 is 1 (`I`) less than 5 (`V`): `IV` and 9 is 1 (`I`) less than 10 (`X`): `IX`. Only the following subtractive forms are used: 4 (`IV`), 9 (`IX`), 40 (`XL`), 90 (`XC`), 400 (`CD`) and 900 (`CM`).</li>
	<li>Only powers of 10 (`I`, `X`, `C`, `M`) can be appended consecutively at most 3 times to represent multiples of 10. You cannot append 5 (`V`), 50 (`L`), or 500 (`D`) multiple times. If you need to append a symbol 4 times use the **subtractive form**.</li>
</ul>

Given an integer, convert it to a Roman numeral.
