## Description

You are given an integer array `nums`.

Partition the array into **three** (possibly empty) <span data-keyword="subsequence-array">subsequences</span> `A`, `B`, and `C` such that every element of `nums` belongs to **exactly** one subsequence.

Your goal is to **maximize** the value of: `XOR(A) + AND(B) + XOR(C)`

where:

<ul>
	<li>`XOR(arr)` denotes the bitwise XOR of all elements in `arr`. If `arr` is empty, its value is defined as 0.</li>
	<li>`AND(arr)` denotes the bitwise AND of all elements in `arr`. If `arr` is empty, its value is defined as 0.</li>
</ul>

Return the **maximum** value achievable.

**Note:** If multiple partitions result in the same **maximum** sum, you can consider any one of them.
