### Overview

Given a table with users and their emails, we want to filter users based on the validity of their email addresses. A valid email should start with a prefix containing only allowed characters and end with the domain `'@leetcode.com'`.

### Approach: Using Regular Expressions

#### Algorithm

In general, if you are asked to match a string, *writing a regular expression pattern to match on* should come first to mind.

RegEx provides various functionality, here are a few relevant ones:

1. $^$: This represents the start of a string or line.

1. `[a-z]`: This represents a character range, matching any character from `a` to `z`.

* `[0-9]`: This represents a character range, matching any character from `0` to `9`.

* `[a-zA-Z]`: This variant matches any character from `a` to `z` or `A` to `Z`. Note that there is no limit to the number of character ranges you can specify inside the square brackets -- you can add additional characters or ranges you want to match.

* $[^a-z]$: This variant matches any character that is not from `a` to `z`. Note that the $^$ character is used to negate the character range, which means it has a different meaning inside the square brackets than outside where it means the start.

1. `[a-z]*`: This represents a character range, matching any character from `a` to `z` zero or more times.

1. `[a-z]+`: This represents a character range, matching any character from `a` to `z` one or more times.

1. `.`: This matches exactly **one** of any character.

1. `\.`: This represents a period character. Note that the backslash is used to escape the period character, as the period character has a special meaning in regular expressions. Also note that in many languages, you need to escape the backslash itself, so you need to use `\\.`.

1. The dollar sign: This represents the end of a string or line.

The key idea here is to separate the first character of the name column from the rest, change their cases accordingly, and then join them back together.

#### Implementation

```python
import pandas as pd

def valid_emails(users: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    # Note how we use a raw string (putting an `r` in front) to avoid having to escape the backslash
    # Also note that we escaped the `@` character, as it has a special meaning in some regex flavors
    return users[users["mail"].str.match(r"^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_.-]*\@leetcode\.com$")]
```

```sql

-- Note that we also escaped the `@` character, as it has a special meaning in some regex flavors
WHERE mail REGEXP '^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_.-]*\\@leetcode\\.com$';
