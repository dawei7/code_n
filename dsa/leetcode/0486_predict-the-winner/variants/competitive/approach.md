## General
Given an integer array `nums`. Two players are playing a game with this array: player 1 and player 2, the algorithm executes a single-pass linear scan through input elements. It utilizes a dynamic programming memoization table to cache intermediate subproblem states. Key operations include bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`) for fast bitmask state updates. Edge case handling: guards against empty/null inputs via early returns, applies modulo arithmetic to prevent integer overflow.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n^2)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(n)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
