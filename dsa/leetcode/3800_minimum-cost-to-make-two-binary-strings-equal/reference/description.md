## Description

You are given two binary strings `s` and `t`, both of length `n`, and three **positive** integers `flipCost`, `swapCost`, and `crossCost`.

You are allowed to apply the following operations any number of times (in any order) to the strings `s` and `t`:

<ul>
	<li>Choose any index `i` and flip `s[i]` or `t[i]` (change `'0'` to `'1'` or `'1'` to `'0'`). The cost of this operation is `flipCost`.</li>
	<li>Choose two **distinct** indices `i` and `j`, and swap either `s[i]` and `s[j]` or `t[i]` and `t[j]`. The cost of this operation is `swapCost`.</li>
	<li>Choose an index `i` and swap `s[i]` with `t[i]`. The cost of this operation is `crossCost`.</li>
</ul>

Return an integer denoting the **minimum** total cost needed to make the strings `s` and `t` equal.
