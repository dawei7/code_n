### Overview

Imagine a university admissions office wants to keep track of the `k-th` highest test scores from applicants in real time. This allows them to dynamically determine the cut-off score as new applications come in. To achieve this, we'll create a class `KthLargest` that can return the `k-th` largest element for an incoming stream of numbers. Specifically, we need to implement:

1. The constructor `KthLargest(int k, int[] nums)`, which initializes the class with `k` and the initial stream of numbers `num`,
2. The function `add(int val)`, which adds a new number `val` into the existing stream of numbers, and returns the `k-th` largest element of the updated stream.

### Approach 1: Maintain Sorted List

### Intuition

In this problem, we need to be able to repeatedly fetch the `k-th` largest element from a growing stream of numbers. Suppose we assume that the stream of numbers is always sorted in ascending order. In that case, returning the `k-th` largest element becomes a straightforward operation of fetching the `k-th` element from the end of the stream.

Thus, one approach is to maintain a list that stores the entire stream of numbers seen so far, and ensure the list remains sorted each time we add a new element. This allows us to fetch the `k-th` largest element with no extra work.

For our constructor, we can initialize our list `stream` with the initial set of numbers `nums` provided, and then sort `stream` in ascending order.

For every new `val` added to the `stream` by the `add(int val)` call, we ensure `val` is inserted at the correct position so that `stream` remains sorted. Because `stream` is sorted beforehand, we can efficiently find the correct position for `val` by using [binary search](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/binary-search/).

For this binary search insertion:

1. We start with the entirety of `stream` as our search space
2. We check the middle element $\text{stream}[mid]$
* If $\text{stream}[mid] = val$ then we know that we can add `val` at index `mid`
* If $\text{stream}[mid] < val$, then `val` needs to be added to the right of $\text{stream}[mid]$, so we limit the search space to the right half of `stream`.
* If $\text{stream}[mid]$ is greater than `val`,`val` needs to be added to the left of $\text{stream}[mid]$, so we limit the search space to the left half of `stream`.
3.  We can repeat this procedure until we narrow down our search space to the correct index to add `val`.

After inserting `val` in the correct position, we can return $stream[\text{stream.length} - k]$, which is the `k-th` largest element in the stream.

### Algorithm

1. In the constructor:
* Initialize class variable `k`
* Initialize class variable list `stream`
* Add all of `nums` to `stream`, used to keep track of the total stream.
* Sort `stream` in ascending order
2. In the `add(int val)` function:
* Call helper function `getIndex(int val)` to find the index `i` to add `val`
* Insert `val` in `stream` at index `i`
* Return the `k-th` largest element in `stream`, at index $\text{stream.size}() - k$
3. In the `getIndex(int val)`:
* **Define starting search space**: Initialize `left` to `0` and `right` to $\text{stream.size}() - 1$
* While $left \le right$:
* **Calculate index for middle element**: Initialize `mid` to $(left + right) / 2$
* **Get middle element**: Initialize `midElement` to `stream.get(mid)`
* If $midElement = val$ return `mid`
* If `midElement > val`:
* **Go to left half of search space**: Reassign `right` to $mid - 1$
* If `midElement < val`:
* **Go to right half of search space**: Reassign `left` to $mid + 1$

### Implementation

```python
class KthLargest:

    def __init__(self, k: int, nums: List[int]):
        self.k = k
        self.stream = nums
        self.stream.sort()

    def add(self, val: int) -> int:
        index = self.getIndex(val)
        # Add val to correct position
        self.stream.insert(index, val)
        return self.stream[-self.k]

    def getIndex(self, val: int) -> int:
        left, right = 0, len(self.stream) - 1
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            mid_element = self.stream[mid]
            if mid_element == val:
                return mid
            # Go to left half
            elif mid_element > val:
                right = mid - 1
            # Go to right half
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        return left
```

### Complexity Analysis

Let $M$ be the size of the initial stream `nums` given in the constructor. Let $N$ be the number of calls of `add`.

* Time Complexity: $O(N^2 + N \cdot M)$

    The constructor involves creating a list `stream` from `nums`, which takes $O(M)$ time. Then, sorting this list takes $O(M \cdot \log M)$ time. Thus, the time complexity of the constructor is $O(M \cdot \log M)$ time.

    The `add` function involves running a binary search on `stream`. Because the total size of `stream` at the end would be $O(M + N)$, each binary search is bounded by a time complexity of $O(\log(M + N))$. Moreover, adding a number in `stream` can take worst-case $O(M + N)$ time, as adding an element in the middle of a list can offset all the elements to its right. Then, the time complexity of a single `add` call would be $O(M + N + \log(M + N))$. Because `add` is called $N$ times, the time complexity of all the `add` calls would be $O(N \cdot (M + N + \log(M + N)))$.

    We see that after expanding the time complexity for the `add` function, the $N \cdot M$ and $N^2$ terms dominate all the other $\log$ terms in our calculations, so the total time complexity is $O(N^2 + N \cdot M)$

* Space Complexity: $O(M + N)$

    The maximum size for `stream` is $M + N$, so the total space complexity is $O(M + N)$.

### Approach 2: Heap

### Intuition

In Approach 1, sorting the entire stream of numbers seems unnecessary because we only need the `k-th` largest element. Maintaining a sorted list becomes costly as its size increases. To optimize, we can focus on only the necessary elements for retrieving and updating the `k-th` largest element.

!?!../Documents/703/slideshow1.json:960,540!?!

Consider a stream of numbers `[0, 4, 6, 9]` where $k = 3$ and incoming $val = 2$. Before adding `2`, the `k-th` largest element is `4`. Adding `2` does not affect `4`'s position since `2` is smaller. Now, if the incoming value is `7`, which is greater than both `4` and `6`, `7` would become the 2nd largest number, pushing `6` to be the new `k-th` largest element, and `4` is no longer in the top `k`.

!?!../Documents/703/slideshow2.json:960,540!?!

From this example, we see that keeping track of just the `k` largest elements allows us to efficiently maintain the `k-th` largest element:
1. **If an incoming element `val` is smaller than or equal to the existing `k-th` largest element**: The `k` largest elements remain unchanged, and we can return the current `k-th` largest element.
2. **If `val` is larger than the current `k-th` largest element**: It replaces the current `k-th` largest element. After adding `val`, the new `k-th` largest element is the next largest element.

To efficiently maintain the `k` largest elements, we use a min-heap. In a min-heap, elements are organized such that the smallest element is always at the top (root node), providing $O(1)$ access time. Adding elements and removing the top element from the min-heap can be done in $O(\log n)$ time.

For our problem, the min-heap will contain the `k` largest elements, with the `k-th` largest element at the top. If a new `val` is greater than the `k-th` largest element, we add `val` to the heap and remove the top element, keeping the heap size at `k` and updating the `k-th` largest element.

In our optimized approach, we initialize the min-heap with the initial stream `nums` in the constructor and ensure it contains only the `k` largest elements. In the `add(int val)` function, if `val` is smaller than the current `k-th` largest element and the heap already contains `k` elements, we return the top element. Otherwise, we add `val`, remove the top element if the heap size exceeds `k`, and return the updated top element.

This approach is more efficient in both time and space complexity compared to maintaining a fully sorted list, as the relaxed ordering of a heap allows quick access and updates to the `k` largest elements without the overhead of sorting the entire stream.

### Algorithm

1. In the constructor:
* Initialize class variable `k` to the input value `k`
* Initialize a class `PriorityQueue` `minHeap` to hold the `k` largest elements
* Iterate through each element `num` in the initial stream `nums`:
* Call `add(num)`
2. In the `add(int val)` function:
* If `val` is greater than the smallest element in `minHeap` or the size of `minHeap` is less than `k` elements:
* Add `val` to `minHeap`
* If the size of `minHeap` is greater than `k`, then remove the top element
* Return the top element as the `k-th` largest element in the stream

### Implementation

```python
class KthLargest:
    def __init__(self, k: int, nums: List[int]):
        self.min_heap = []
        self.k = k

        for num in nums:
            self.add(num)

    def add(self, val: int) -> int:
        # Add to our min_heap if we haven't processed k elements yet
        # or if val is greater than the top element (the k-th largest)
        if len(self.min_heap) < self.k or self.min_heap[0] < val:
            heapq.heappush(self.min_heap, val)
            if len(self.min_heap) > self.k:
                heapq.heappop(self.min_heap)
        return self.min_heap[0]
```

### Complexity Analysis

Let $M$ be the size of the initial stream `nums` given in the constructor, and let $N$ be the number of calls to `add`.

* Time Complexity: $O((M + N) \cdot \log k)$

    The `add` function involves adding and removing an element from a heap of size $k$, which is an $O( \log k)$ operation. Since the `add` function is called $N$ times, the total time complexity for all `add` calls is $O(N \cdot \log k)$.

    The constructor also calls `add` $M$ times to initialize the heap, leading to a time complexity of $O(M \cdot \log k)$.

    Therefore, the overall time complexity is $O((M + N) \cdot \log k)$.

* Space Complexity: $O(k)$

    The `minHeap` maintains at most $k$ elements, so the space complexity is $O(k)$.
