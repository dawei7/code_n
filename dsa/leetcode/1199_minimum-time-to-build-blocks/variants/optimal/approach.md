## General
### Beginner-Friendly Intuition & Strategy
The core task in **Minimum Time to Build Blocks** is to a list of blocks, where $\text{blocks}[i] = t$ means that the `i`-th block needs `t` units of time to be built. A block can only be built by exactly one worker. To dynamically keep track of the minimum or maximum value without sorting the entire array repeatedly, this solution uses a **Min/Max Heap (Priority Queue)**. It allows us to insert elements and extract the smallest/largest value in fast logarithmic $O(\log k)$ time.

### Step-by-Step Execution Guide
**Step 1: Setup & Base Cases**  
We set up tracking variables (accumulators, counters, or pointers) to hold intermediate results.  
**Step 2: Core Processing & Traversal**  
1. Iterate sequentially through each element.  
2. Apply operational rules to update state variables.  
**Step 3: Completion & Return**  
When processing finishes, the algorithm outputs the final validated solution.

### Why This Handles Edge Cases Gracefully
- **Single Element / Border Cases:** Loop bounds handle single items and empty inputs naturally.


## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n\log n)$ — Detailed Analysis: The time complexity corresponds directly to the total number of operations required by the step-by-step execution loop described above.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$ — Detailed Analysis: The space complexity reflects the auxiliary memory allocated for tracking structures, recursion stack depth, or hash maps during processing.
