## General
Given two **positive** integers `startPos` and `endPos`. Initially, you are standing at position `startPos` on an **infinite** number line. With one step, you can move either one position to the left, or one position to the..., the algorithm executes depth-first search (DFS) recursion to explore valid decision branches. It utilizes a hash map (`dict`) to store element values and their indices/frequencies for $O(1)$ fast access. Edge case handling: applies modulo arithmetic to prevent integer overflow.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(k)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
