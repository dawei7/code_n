## Description

You are given a 2D integer array `grid` of size `m x n`, and an integer `limit`.

You may remove zero or more columns from the grid, but at least one column must remain. The **relative** order of the remaining columns must be preserved.

A grid is called **consistent** if for every row `i`, and for every pair of adjacent remaining columns `a` and `b` with `a < b`, the following holds: `|grid[i][b] - grid[i][a]| <= limit`.

Return the **maximum** number of columns that can remain such that the resulting grid is **consistent**.
