### Approach: Frequency Counter

**Intuition**

The first thing to observe here is how many rows we need at least to ensure each row has distinct integers. Each repeated integer in the original array `nums` needs to be placed in a separate row. Therefore, we need at least as many rows as the maximum frequency of integers in the array `nums`.

Now, we know that if an integer has $K$ instances, it would be kept in $K$ different rows. So we can keep placing each instance in the row with an index equal to the current frequency. The $0-\text{th}$ instance of this integer will kept at row index `0`, the $1-\text{st}$ instance at row index `1`, and so on till the $(K - 1)-\text{th}$ instance at the row index $K - 1$. Note that, if there is one integer with $K1$ instances and another integer with $K2$ instances, we need $max(K1, K2)$ rows but not $K1 + K2$ rows. This is because we can have just $max(K1, K2)$ rows and the other integer with fewer instances can be also stored in these rows.

We generally use a HashMap to store the frequencies. However, as mentioned in the problem, the values in the array would be up to the length of the array (which can be up to `200`). Since we know the range of the values, it's efficient to use an array with a size of $N + 1$, where $N$ is the length of `nums`. We will be using the array `freq` for this purpose. Now, we will iterate over the integers in the array `nums` and retrieve the current frequency of the integer from `freq`.

If the frequency of the current integer is greater than the current size of the two-dimensional array `ans`, indicating that we need to start a new row to store this element, so we add a row and insert the element into the new row.

Then we increment the frequency of this integer.

**Algorithm**

1. Create an array `freq` of size $\text{nums.size}() + 1$ to store the frequency of integers in the array `nums`.
2. Create an empty 2D array `ans` to store the answer array.
3. Iterate over the array `nums` and for each integer `c`:

   a. If the frequency of the integer is greater than or equal to the current rows count in `ans`, then add a row to `ans`.

   b. Insert the integer `c` at the row $\text{freq}[c]$.

   c. Increment the frequency of `c` in `freq`.
4. Return `ans`.

**Implementation**

```python
class Solution:
    def findMatrix(self, nums: list[int]) -> list[list[int]]:
        freq = [0] * (len(nums) + 1)

        ans = []
        for c in nums:
            if freq[c] >= len(ans):
                ans.append([])

            # Store the integer in the list corresponding to its current frequency.
            ans[freq[c]].append(c)
            freq[c] += 1

        return ans
```

**Complexity Analysis**

Here, $N$ is the size of array `nums`.

* Time complexity: $O(N)$

  We iterate over the array `nums` once to insert them into the 2D array `ans`. Accessing `freq` and incrementing it takes $O(1)$. Hence, the total time complexity is equal to $O(N)$.

* Space complexity: $O(N)$

  The size of the frequency array `freq` is equal to $\text{nums.size}() + 1$ as the value of integers in the array `nums` can be up to `nums.size()`. Hence, the total space complexity is equal to $O(N)$.
