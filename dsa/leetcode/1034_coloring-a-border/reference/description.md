## Description

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid`, and three integers `row`, `col`, and `color`. Each value in the grid represents the color of the grid square at that location.

Two squares are called **adjacent** if they are next to each other in any of the 4 directions.

Two squares belong to the same **connected component** if they have the same color and they are adjacent.

The **border of a connected component** is all the squares in the connected component that are either adjacent to (at least) a square not in the component, or on the boundary of the grid (the first or last row or column).

You should color the **border** of the **connected component** that contains the square `grid[row][col]` with `color`.

Return *the final grid*.
