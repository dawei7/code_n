## General
Given the `root` of a binary tree with **unique** values, and an integer `start`. At minute `0`, an **infection** starts from the node with value `start`, the algorithm executes a two-pointer approach to shrink boundaries or maintain a sliding window. It utilizes a hash map (`dict`) to store element values and their indices/frequencies for $O(1)$ fast access, a dynamic programming memoization table to cache intermediate subproblem states, binary tree node references (`val`, `left`, `right`) to traverse structural hierarchies.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(n)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
