## Description

You have a video sharing platform where users can upload and delete videos. Each `video` is a **string** of digits, where the $$i^{\text{th}}$$ digit of the string represents the content of the video at minute `i`. For example, the first digit represents the content at minute `0` in the video, the second digit represents the content at minute `1` in the video, and so on. Viewers of videos can also like and dislike videos. Internally, the platform keeps track of the **number of views, likes, and dislikes** on each video.

When a video is uploaded, it is associated with the smallest available integer `videoId` starting from `0`. Once a video is deleted, the `videoId` associated with that video can be reused for another video.

Implement the `VideoSharingPlatform` class:

- `VideoSharingPlatform()` Initializes the object.

- `int upload(String video)` The user uploads a `video`. Return the `videoId` associated with the video.

- `void remove(int videoId)` If there is a video associated with `videoId`, remove the video.

- `String watch(int videoId, int startMinute, int endMinute)` If there is a video associated with `videoId`, increase the number of views on the video by `1` and return the substring of the video string starting at `startMinute` and ending at $min(endMinute, \text{video.length} - 1$)` (**inclusive**). Otherwise, return `"-1"`.

- `void like(int videoId)` Increases the number of likes on the video associated with `videoId` by `1` if there is a video associated with `videoId`.

- `void dislike(int videoId)` Increases the number of dislikes on the video associated with `videoId` by `1` if there is a video associated with `videoId`.

- `int[] getLikesAndDislikes(int videoId)` Return a **0-indexed** integer array `values` of length `2` where $\text{values}[0]$ is the number of likes and $\text{values}[1]$ is the number of dislikes on the video associated with `videoId`. If there is no video associated with `videoId`, return `[-1]`.

- `int getViews(int videoId)` Return the number of views on the video associated with `videoId`, if there is no video associated with `videoId`, return `-1`.
### Function Contract

**Methods**

- `VideoSharingPlatform()`: Initializes the object.
- `upload(video: str) -> int`: Uploads a video (a digit string), assigns the smallest available nonnegative `videoId`, and initializes views, likes, and dislikes to 0. Returns `videoId`.
- `remove(videoId: int) -> None`: Removes `videoId` if present, releasing `videoId` for reuse in future uploads. If `videoId` does not exist, does nothing.
- `watch(videoId: int, startMinute: int, endMinute: int) -> str`: If `videoId` exists, increments its view count by 1 and returns the substring from `startMinute` to $min(endMinute, \text{video.length} - 1)$ inclusive. If `videoId` does not exist, returns `"-1"`.
- `like(videoId: int) -> None`: Increments likes for `videoId` by 1 if present; otherwise does nothing.
- `dislike(videoId: int) -> None`: Increments dislikes for `videoId` by 1 if present; otherwise does nothing.
- $getLikesAndDislikes(videoId: int) -> \text{list}[int]$: If `videoId` exists, returns `[likes, dislikes]`. If `videoId` does not exist, returns `[-1]`.
- `getViews(videoId: int) -> int`: If `videoId` exists, returns the view count. If `videoId` does not exist, returns `-1`.

### Examples

#### Example 1

```
**Input**
["VideoSharingPlatform", "upload", "upload", "remove", "remove", "upload", "watch", "watch", "like", "dislike", "dislike", "getLikesAndDislikes", "getViews"]
[[], ["123"], ["456"], [4], [0], ["789"], [1, 0, 5], [1, 0, 1], [1], [1], [1], [1], [1]]
**Output**
[null, 0, 1, null, null, 0, "456", "45", null, null, null, [1, 2], 2]

**Explanation**
VideoSharingPlatform videoSharingPlatform = new VideoSharingPlatform();
videoSharingPlatform.upload("123");          // The smallest available videoId is 0, so return 0.
videoSharingPlatform.upload("456");          // The smallest available videoId is 1, so return 1.
videoSharingPlatform.remove(4);              // There is no video associated with videoId 4, so do nothing.
videoSharingPlatform.remove(0);              // Remove the video associated with videoId 0.
videoSharingPlatform.upload("789");          // Since the video associated with videoId 0 was deleted,
                                             // 0 is the smallest available videoId, so return 0.
videoSharingPlatform.watch(1, 0, 5);         // The video associated with videoId 1 is "456".
                                             // The video from minute 0 to min(5, 3 - 1) = 2 is "456", so return "456".
videoSharingPlatform.watch(1, 0, 1);         // The video associated with videoId 1 is "456".
                                             // The video from minute 0 to min(1, 3 - 1) = 1 is "45", so return "45".
videoSharingPlatform.like(1);                // Increase the number of likes on the video associated with videoId 1.
videoSharingPlatform.dislike(1);             // Increase the number of dislikes on the video associated with videoId 1.
videoSharingPlatform.dislike(1);             // Increase the number of dislikes on the video associated with videoId 1.
videoSharingPlatform.getLikesAndDislikes(1); // There is 1 like and 2 dislikes on the video associated with videoId 1, so return [1, 2].
videoSharingPlatform.getViews(1);            // The video associated with videoId 1 has 2 views, so return 2.
```
#### Example 2

```
**Input**
["VideoSharingPlatform", "remove", "watch", "like", "dislike", "getLikesAndDislikes", "getViews"]
[[], [0], [0, 0, 1], [0], [0], [0], [0]]
**Output**
[null, null, "-1", null, null, [-1], -1]

**Explanation**
VideoSharingPlatform videoSharingPlatform = new VideoSharingPlatform();
videoSharingPlatform.remove(0);              // There is no video associated with videoId 0, so do nothing.
videoSharingPlatform.watch(0, 0, 1);         // There is no video associated with videoId 0, so return "-1".
videoSharingPlatform.like(0);                // There is no video associated with videoId 0, so do nothing.
videoSharingPlatform.dislike(0);             // There is no video associated with videoId 0, so do nothing.
videoSharingPlatform.getLikesAndDislikes(0); // There is no video associated with videoId 0, so return [-1].
videoSharingPlatform.getViews(0);            // There is no video associated with videoId 0, so return -1.
```
### Constraints

- $1 \le \text{video.length} \le 10^{5}$

- The sum of `video.length` over all calls to `upload` does not exceed $10^{5}$

- `video` consists of digits.

- $0 \le videoId \le 10^{5}$

- $0 \le startMinute < endMinute < 10^{5}$

- `startMinute < video.length`

- The sum of $endMinute - startMinute$ over all calls to `watch` does not exceed $10^{5}$.

- At most $10^{5}$ calls **in total** will be made to all functions.
