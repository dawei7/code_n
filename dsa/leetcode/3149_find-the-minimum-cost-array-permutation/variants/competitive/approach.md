## General
Given an array `nums` which is a permutation of `[0, 1, 2, ..., n - 1]`. The **score** of any permutation of `[0, 1, 2, ..., n - 1]` named `perm` is defined as:, the algorithm executes a single-pass linear scan through input elements. It utilizes a dynamic programming memoization table to cache intermediate subproblem states. Key operations include bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`) for fast bitmask state updates.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n^2 2^n)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(n 2^n)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
