## Description

You are given an integer array `timeReq` and an integer `splitTime`.

In the microscopic world of the human body, the immune system faces an extraordinary challenge: combatting a rapidly multiplying bacterial colony that threatens the body's survival.

Initially, only one **white blood cell** (**WBC**) is deployed to eliminate the bacteria. However, the lone WBC quickly realizes it cannot keep up with the bacterial growth rate.

The WBC devises a clever strategy to fight the bacteria:

	- The `i^th` bacterial strain takes `timeReq[i]` units of time to be eliminated.

	- A single WBC can eliminate **only one** bacterial strain. Afterwards, the WBC is exhausted and cannot perform any other tasks.

	- A WBC can split itself into two WBCs, but this requires `splitTime` units of time. Once split, the two WBCs can work in **parallel** on eliminating the bacteria.

	- *Only one* WBC can work on a single bacterial strain. Multiple WBCs **cannot** attack one strain in parallel.

You must determine the **minimum** time required to eliminate all the bacterial strains.

**Note** that the bacterial strains can be eliminated in any order.

**Example 1:**

<div class="example-block">
**Input:** <span class="example-io">timeReq = [10,4,5], splitTime = 2</span>

**Output:** <span class="example-io">12</span>

**Explanation:**

The elimination process goes as follows:

	- Initially, there is a single WBC. The WBC splits into 2 WBCs after 2 units of time.

	- One of the WBCs eliminates strain 0 at a time `t = 2 + 10 = 12.` The other WBC splits again, using 2 units of time.

	- The 2 new WBCs eliminate the bacteria at times `t = 2 + 2 + 4` and `t = 2 + 2 + 5`.

</div>

**Example 2:**

<div class="example-block">
**Input:** <span class="example-io">timeReq = [10,4], splitTime = 5</span>

**Output:**15

**Explanation:**

The elimination process goes as follows:

	- Initially, there is a single WBC. The WBC splits into 2 WBCs after 5 units of time.

	- The 2 new WBCs eliminate the bacteria at times `t = 5 + 10` and `t = 5 + 4`.

</div>

**Constraints:**

	- `2 <= timeReq.length <= 10^5`

	- `1 <= timeReq[i] <= 10^9`

	- `1 <= splitTime <= 10^9`
