## Solution

### Approach 1: Enumeration

#### Intuition

We try every possible number of candies, $x$, that could be distributed to the first child. After, there are $n - x$ candies left. At this point, we consider two scenarios:

+ If $n - x > \textit{limit} \times 2$, then at least one of the remaining two children must receive more than $\textit{limit}$ candies. In this case, there is no valid distribution.

+ If $n - x \le \textit{limit} \times 2$, then the second child must receive **at least** $\max(0, n - x - \textit{limit})$ candies to ensure the third child does not receive more than $\textit{limit}$ candies. **At most**, the second child can receive $\min(\textit{limit}, n - x)$ candies.

For the second case, we can count all valid distributions.

#### Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def distributeCandies(self, n: int, limit: int) -> int:
        ans = 0
        for i in range(min(limit, n) + 1):
            if n - i > 2 * limit:
                continue
            ans += min(n - i, limit) - max(0, n - i - limit) + 1
        return ans
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity: $O(\min(\textit{limit}, n))$.

  We iterate over all possible values of candies that can be given to the first child, which ranges from $0$ to $\min(\textit{limit}, n)$. For each such value, we perform constant-time calculations.

- Space complexity: $O(1)$.

  Only a few additional variables are needed.

### Approach 2: Inclusion-Exclusion Principle

#### Intuition

We can also solve this using a classical counting method: subtracting the number of invalid distributions from the total number of possible distributions. By applying the inclusion-exclusion principle, we subtract the number of distributions in which at least one child receives more than `limit` candies. However, in doing so, we may subtract some distributions multiple times - specifically, the ones where **two or more children** receive more than `limit` candies. To correct this, we add back the number of cases where **at least two** children exceed the limit. But now we've overcounted the distributions where **all three** children exceed the limit, so we subtract those again.

Now let's go through each case in detail:

* **Total number of unrestricted distributions:**
  Since children are allowed to receive zero candies, distributing `n` candies among 3 children is equivalent to placing two dividers among `n` candies to split them into three groups. The number of such distributions is given by the combination:

  $C_{n + 2}^2$

* **At least one child receives more than `limit` candies:**
  We give $limit + 1$ candies to one child first, reducing the problem to distributing $n - (limit + 1)$ candies among 3 children (with possible zeroes). There are 3 choices for which child gets the extra candies, so:

  $3 \times C_{n - (limit + 1) + 2}^2$

* **At least two children receive more than `limit` candies:**
  We give $limit + 1$ candies to any two children, reducing the problem to distributing $n - 2 \times (limit + 1)$ candies among 3 children. There are 3 ways to choose the two children:

  $3 \times C_{n - 2 \times (limit + 1) + 2}^2$

* **All three children receive more than `limit` candies:**
  We give $limit + 1$ candies to each child, so we're left with $n - 3 \times (limit + 1)$ candies to distribute among 3 children. The number of such distributions is:

  $C_{n - 3 \times (limit + 1) + 2}^2$

Finally, applying inclusion-exclusion gives the answer:

$C_{n+2}^2 - 3 \times C_{n - (limit + 1) + 2}^2 + 3 \times C_{n - 2 \times (limit + 1) + 2}^2 - C_{n - 3 \times (limit + 1) + 2}^2$

#### Implementation

```python
def cal(x):
    if x < 0:
        return 0
    return x * (x - 1) // 2

class Solution:
    def distributeCandies(self, n: int, limit: int) -> int:
        return (
            cal(n + 2)
- 3 * cal(n - limit + 1)
            + 3 * cal(n - (limit + 1) * 2 + 2)
- cal(n - 3 * (limit + 1) + 2)
        )
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity: $O(1)$.

  The result can be calculated directly.

- Space complexity: $O(1)$.

  Only a few additional variables are needed.
