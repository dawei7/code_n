## General
Given an integer array `arr` and a target value `target`, return the integer `value` such that when we change all the integers larger than `value` in the given array to be equal to `value`, the sum of the array gets as clos..., the algorithm executes a single-pass linear scan through input elements. It utilizes a hash map (`dict`) to store element values and their indices/frequencies for $O(1)$ fast access.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n \log M)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
