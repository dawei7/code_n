## General
Given an array of strings `words` representing an English Dictionary, return *the longest word in* `words` *that can be built one character at a time by other words in* `words`, the algorithm executes depth-first search (DFS) recursion to explore valid decision branches. It utilizes a hash map (`dict`) to store element values and their indices/frequencies for $O(1)$ fast access. Edge case handling: guards against empty/null inputs via early returns.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(S)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(S)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
