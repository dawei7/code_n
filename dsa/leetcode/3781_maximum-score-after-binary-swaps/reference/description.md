## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and a binary string `s` of the same length.

Initially, your score is 0. Each index `i` where `s[i] = '1'` contributes `nums[i]` to the score.

You may perform **any** number of operations (including zero). In one operation, you may choose an index `i` such that `0 <= i < n - 1`, where `s[i] = '0'`, and `s[i + 1] = '1'`, and swap these two characters.

Return an integer denoting the **maximum possible score** you can achieve.
