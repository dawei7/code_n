## Description

You are given an **undirected tree** with `n` nodes, numbered from 0 to `n - 1`. It is represented by a 2D integer array `edges`​​​​​​​ of length `n - 1`, where `edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `a_i` and `b_i` in the tree.

You are also given two **binary** strings `start` and `target` of length `n`. For each node `x`, `start[x]` is its initial color and `target[x]` is its desired color.

In one operation, you may pick an edge with index `i` and **toggle **both of its endpoints. That is, if the edge is `[u, v]`, then the colors of nodes `u` and `v` **each** flip from `'0'` to `'1'` or from `'1'` to `'0'`.

Return an array of edge indices whose operations transform `start` into `target`. Among all valid sequences with **minimum possible length**, return the edge indices in **increasing**​​​​​​​ order.

If it is impossible to transform `start` into `target`, return an array containing a single element equal to -1.
