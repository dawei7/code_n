## General
Given A string `s` is **nice** if, for every letter of the alphabet that `s` contains, it appears **both** in uppercase and lowercase. For example, `"abABB"` is nice because `'A'` and `'a'` appear, and `'B'` and `'b'` appea..., the algorithm executes a single-pass linear scan through input elements. It utilizes a hash set (`set`) to track unique elements and prevent duplicate processing in $O(1)$ time.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n^2)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(n^2)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
