## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `maxC`.

A **<span data-keyword="subarray">subarray</span>** is called **stable** if the *highest common factor (HCF)* of all its elements is **greater than or equal to** 2.

The **stability factor** of an array is defined as the length of its **longest** stable subarray.

You may modify **at most** `maxC` elements of the array to any integer.

Return the **minimum** possible stability factor of the array after at most `maxC` modifications. If no stable subarray remains, return 0.

**Note:**

<ul>
	<li>The **highest common factor (HCF)** of an array is the largest integer that evenly divides all the array elements.</li>
	<li>A **subarray** of length 1 is stable if its only element is greater than or equal to 2, since `HCF([x]) = x`.</li>
</ul>
