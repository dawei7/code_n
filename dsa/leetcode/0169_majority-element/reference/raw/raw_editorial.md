### Approach 1: Brute Force

#### Intuition

We can exhaust the search space in quadratic time by checking whether each
element is the majority element.

#### Algorithm

The brute force algorithm iterates over the array, and then iterates again
for each number to count its occurrences. As soon as a number is found to
have appeared more than any other can possibly have appeared, return it.

#### Implementation


```python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums):
        majority_count = len(nums) // 2
        for num in nums:
            count = sum(1 for elem in nums if elem == num)
            if count > majority_count:
                return num
```


#### Complexity Analysis

* Time complexity : $O(n^2)$

    The brute force algorithm contains two nested `for` loops that each run
    for $n$ iterations, adding up to quadratic time complexity.

* Space complexity : $O(1)$

    The brute force solution does not allocate additional space proportional
    to the input size.

### Approach 2: HashMap

#### Intuition

We know that the majority element occurs more than $\lfloor \dfrac{n}{2} \rfloor$
times, and a `HashMap` allows us to count element occurrences efficiently.

#### Algorithm

We can use a `HashMap` that maps elements to counts in order to count
occurrences in linear time by looping over `nums`. Then, we simply return the
key with maximum value.

#### Implementation


```python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums):
        counts = collections.Counter(nums)
        return max(counts.keys(), key=counts.get)
```


#### Complexity Analysis

* Time complexity : $O(n)$

    We iterate over `nums` once and make a constant time `HashMap` insertion
    on each iteration. Therefore, the algorithm runs in $O(n)$ time.

* Space complexity : $O(n)$

    At most, the `HashMap` can contain $n - \lfloor \dfrac{n}{2} \rfloor$
    associations, so it occupies $O(n)$ space. This is because an arbitrary
    array of length $n$ can contain $n$ distinct values, but `nums` is
    guaranteed to contain a majority element, which will occupy (at minimum)
    $\lfloor \dfrac{n}{2} \rfloor + 1$ array indices. Therefore,
    $n - (\lfloor \dfrac{n}{2} \rfloor + 1)$ indices can be occupied by
    distinct, non-majority elements (plus 1 for the majority element itself),
    leaving us with (at most) $n - \lfloor \dfrac{n}{2} \rfloor$ distinct
    elements.

### Approach 3: Sorting

#### Intuition

If the elements are sorted in monotonically increasing (or decreasing) order,
the majority element can be found at index
$\lfloor \dfrac{n}{2} \rfloor$ (and also at $\lfloor \dfrac{n}{2} \rfloor - 1$, if $n$ is even).

#### Algorithm

For this algorithm, we simply do exactly what is described: sort `nums`, and
return the element in question. To see why this will always return the
majority element (given that the array has one), consider the figure below
(the top example is for an odd-length array and the bottom is for an
even-length array):


![Sorting middle index overlap](images/sorting.png)


For each example, the line below the array denotes the range of indices that
are covered by a majority element that happens to be the array minimum. As
you might expect, the line above the array is similar, but for the case where
the majority element is also the array maximum. In all other cases, this line
will lie somewhere between these two, but notice that even in these two most
extreme cases, they overlap at index $\lfloor \dfrac{n}{2} \rfloor$ for both
even- and odd-length arrays. Therefore, no matter what value the majority
element has in relation to the rest of the array, returning the value at
$\lfloor \dfrac{n}{2} \rfloor$ will never be wrong.

#### Implementation


```python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums):
        nums.sort()
        return nums[len(nums) // 2]
```


#### Complexity Analysis

* Time complexity : $O(nlgn)$

    Sorting the array costs $O(nlgn)$ time in Python and Java, so it
    dominates the overall runtime.

* Space complexity : $O(1)$ or ($O(n)$)

    We sorted `nums` in place here - if that is not allowed, then we must
    spend linear additional space on a copy of `nums` and sort the copy
    instead.

### Approach 4: Bit Manipulation

#### Intuition

If an element `majority_element` occurs more than $\lfloor \dfrac{n}{2} \rfloor$ times, then there are at least $\lfloor \dfrac{n}{2} \rfloor$ elements of identical values with `num` at each bit. That is, we can reconstruct the exact value of `num` by combining the most frequent value (0 or 1) at each bit.

#### Algorithm

Starting from the least significant bit, we enumerate each bit to determine which value is the majority at this bit, 0 or 1, and put this value to the corresponding bit of the result. Finally, we end up with the most least significant bit of all elements and return the result.

#### Implementation

Because all numbers are in the range $[-10^9, 10^9]$, which can be represented in 32-bit, we only need to enumerate 32 bits.

For Python solution, notice that the sign of an integer is not represented in its bits. To check if the majority element is positive or negative, we need to figure out the majority sign additionally. 


```python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        majority_element = 0

        bit = 1
        for i in range(31):
            # Count how many numbers have the current bit set.
            bit_count = sum(bool(num & bit) for num in nums)

            # If this bit is present in more than n / 2 elements
            # then it must be set in the majority element.
            if bit_count > n // 2:
                majority_element += bit

            # Shift bit to the left one space. i.e. '00100' << 1 = '01000'
            bit = bit << 1

        # In python 1 << 31 will automatically be considered as positive value
        # so we will count how many numbers are negative to determine if
        # the majority element is negative.
        is_negative = sum(num < 0 for num in nums) > (n // 2)

        # When evaluating a 32-bit signed integer, the values of the 1st through
        # 31st bits are added to the total while the value of the 32nd bit is
        # subtracted from the total. This is because the 32nd bit is responsible
        # for signifying if the number is positive or negative.
        if is_negative:
            majority_element -= bit

        return majority_element
```


#### Complexity Analysis

* Time complexity : $O(n\log{C})$
  
  $C$ is the max absolute value in `nums`, i.e., $10^5$ in this problem. We enumerate all $\log{C}$ bits for each number in `nums`.

* Space complexity: $O(1)$

  We count the majority of each bit in $O(1)$ space as it only has the two potential values, 0 and 1. After that, we only need to put the majority values to their corresponding bit in the returned result, and no extra space is used.

### Approach 5: Randomization

#### Intuition

Because more than $\lfloor \dfrac{n}{2} \rfloor$ array indices are occupied
by the majority element, a random array index is likely to contain the
majority element.

#### Algorithm

Because a given index is likely to have the majority element, we can just
select a random index, check whether its value is the majority element,
return if it is, and repeat if it is not. The algorithm is verifiably correct
because we ensure that the randomly chosen value is the majority element
before ever returning.

#### Implementation


```python
import random


class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums):
        majority_count = len(nums) // 2
        while True:
            candidate = random.choice(nums)
            if sum(1 for elem in nums if elem == candidate) > majority_count:
                return candidate
```


#### Complexity Analysis

* Time complexity : $O(\infty)$

    It is technically possible for this algorithm to run indefinitely (if we
    never manage to randomly select the majority element), so the worst
    possible runtime is unbounded. However, the expected runtime is far
    better - linear, in fact. For ease of analysis, convince yourself that
    because the majority element is guaranteed to occupy _more_ than half of
    the array, the expected number of iterations will be less than it would
    be if the element we sought occupied exactly _half_ of the array.
    Therefore, we can calculate the expected number of iterations for this
    modified version of the problem and assert that our version is easier.

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        EV(iters_{prob}) &\leq EV(iters_{mod}) \\
                         &= \lim_{n\to\infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} i \cdot \frac{1}{2^i} \\
                         &= 2
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    Because the series converges, the expected number of iterations for the
    modified problem is constant. Based on an expected-constant number of
    iterations in which we perform linear work, the expected runtime is
    linear for the modifed problem. Therefore, the expected runtime for our
    problem is also linear, as the runtime of the modifed problem serves as
    an upper bound for it.

* Space complexity : $O(1)$

    Much like the brute force solution, the randomized approach runs with
    constant additional space.

### Approach 6: Divide and Conquer

#### Intuition

If we know the majority element in the left and right halves of an array, we
can determine which is the global majority element in linear time.

#### Algorithm

Here, we apply a classical divide & conquer approach that recurses on the
left and right halves of an array until an answer can be trivially achieved
for a length-1 array. Note that because actually passing copies of subarrays
costs time and space, we instead pass `lo` and `hi` indices that describe the
relevant slice of the overall array. In this case, the majority element for a
length-1 slice is trivially its only element, so the recursion stops there.
If the current slice is longer than length-1, we must combine the answers for
the slice's left and right halves. If they agree on the majority element,
then the majority element for the overall slice is obviously the same[^1]. If
they disagree, only one of them can be "right", so we need to count the
occurrences of the left and right majority elements to determine which
subslice's answer is globally correct. The overall answer for the array is
thus the majority element between indices 0 and $n$.

#### Implementation


```python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums, lo=0, hi=None):
        def majority_element_rec(lo, hi):
            # base case; the only element in an array of size 1 is the majority
            # element.
            if lo == hi:
                return nums[lo]

            # recurse on left and right halves of this slice.
            mid = (hi - lo) // 2 + lo
            left = majority_element_rec(lo, mid)
            right = majority_element_rec(mid + 1, hi)

            # if the two halves agree on the majority element, return it.
            if left == right:
                return left

            # otherwise, count each element and return the "winner".
            left_count = sum(1 for i in range(lo, hi + 1) if nums[i] == left)
            right_count = sum(1 for i in range(lo, hi + 1) if nums[i] == right)

            return left if left_count > right_count else right

        return majority_element_rec(0, len(nums) - 1)
```


#### Complexity Analysis

* Time complexity : $O(nlgn)$

    Each recursive call to `majority_element_rec` performs two recursive
    calls on subslices of size $\frac{n}{2}$ and two linear scans of length
    $n$. Therefore, the time complexity of the divide & conquer approach
    can be represented by the following recurrence relation:

    $
        T(n) = 2T(\frac{n}{2}) + 2n
    $

    By the [master theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_theorem_(analysis_of_algorithms)),
    the recurrence satisfies case 2, so the complexity can be analyzed as such:

    $
    \begin{aligned}
        T(n) &= \Theta(n^{log_{b}a}\log n) \\
             &= \Theta(n^{log_{2}2}\log n) \\
             &= \Theta(n \log n) \\
    \end{aligned}
    $

* Space complexity : $O(lgn)$

    Although the divide & conquer does not explicitly allocate any additional
    memory, it uses a non-constant amount of additional memory in stack
    frames due to recursion. Because the algorithm "cuts" the array in half
    at each level of recursion, it follows that there can only be $O(lgn)$
    "cuts" before the base case of 1 is reached. It follows from this fact
    that the resulting recursion tree is balanced, and therefore all paths
    from the root to a leaf are of length $O(lgn)$. Because the recursion
    tree is traversed in a depth-first manner, the space complexity is
    therefore equivalent to the length of the longest path, which is, of
    course, $O(lgn)$.

### Approach 7: Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm

#### Intuition

If we had some way of counting instances of the majority element as $+1$
and instances of any other element as $-1$, summing them would make it
obvious that the majority element is indeed the majority element.

#### Algorithm

Essentially, what Boyer-Moore does is look for a suffix $suf$ of `nums`
where $suf[0]$ is the majority element in that suffix. To do this, we
maintain a count, which is incremented whenever we see an instance of our
current candidate for majority element and decremented whenever we see
anything else. Whenever `count` equals 0, we effectively forget about
everything in `nums` up to the current index and consider the current number
as the candidate for majority element. It is not immediately obvious why we can
get away with forgetting prefixes of `nums` - consider the following
examples (pipes are inserted to separate runs of nonzero `count`).

[7, 7, 5, 7, 5, 1 | 5, 7 | 5, 5, 7, 7 | 7, 7, 7, 7]

Here, the `7` at index 0 is selected to be the first candidate for majority
element. `count` will eventually reach 0 after index 5 is processed, so the
`5` at index 6 will be the next candidate. In this case, `7` is the true
majority element, so by disregarding this prefix, we are ignoring an equal
number of majority and minority elements - therefore, `7` will still be the
majority element in the suffix formed by throwing away the first prefix.

[7, 7, 5, 7, 5, 1 | 5, 7 | 5, 5, 7, 7 | **5, 5, 5, 5**]

Now, the majority element is `5` (we changed the last run of the array from
`7`s to `5`s), but our first candidate is still `7`. In this case, our
candidate is not the true majority element, but we still cannot discard more
majority elements than minority elements (this would imply that `count` could
reach -1 before we reassign `candidate`, which is obviously false).

Therefore, given that it is impossible (in both cases) to discard more
majority elements than minority elements, we are safe in discarding the
prefix and attempting to recursively solve the majority element problem for the
suffix. Eventually, a suffix will be found for which `count` does not hit
`0`, and the majority element of that suffix will necessarily be the same as
the majority element of the overall array.

#### Implementation


```python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums):
        count = 0
        candidate = None

        for num in nums:
            if count == 0:
                candidate = num
            count += 1 if num == candidate else -1

        return candidate
```


#### Complexity Analysis

* Time complexity : $O(n)$

    Boyer-Moore performs constant work exactly $n$ times, so the algorithm
    runs in linear time.

* Space complexity : $O(1)$

    Boyer-Moore allocates only constant additional memory.
