## Description

You are given a 2D integer array `occupiedIntervals`, where `occupiedIntervals[i] = [start_i, end_i]` represents a time interval during which you are occupied. Each interval starts at `start_i` and ends at `end_i`, **inclusive**. These intervals may **overlap**.

You are also given two integers `freeStart` and `freeEnd`, which define a free time interval from `freeStart` to `freeEnd`, inclusive.

Your task is to merge **all** occupied intervals that overlap or touch, then remove **all** integer points in the free interval from the merged occupied intervals.

Two intervals touch if the second interval starts **immediately after** the first one ends. For example, `[1, 1]` and `[2, 2]` touch and should be merged into `[1, 2]`.

Return the **remaining** occupied intervals in **sorted** order. The returned intervals must be **non-overlapping** and must contain the **minimum** number of intervals possible. If there are no remaining occupied points, return an empty list.
