### Approach: Greedy

**Intuition**

Finding the minimum number of intervals to remove is equivalent to finding the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals. This is the famous [interval scheduling problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_scheduling).

Let's start by considering the intervals according to their end times. Consider the two intervals with the earliest end times. Let's say the earlier end time is `x` and the later one is `y`. We have `x < y`.

If we can only choose to keep one interval, should we choose the one ending at `x` or ending at `y`? To avoid overlap, We should always greedily choose the interval with an earlier end time `x`. The intuition behind this can be summarized as follows:

- We choose either `x` or `y`. Let's call our choice `k`.
- To avoid overlap, the next interval we choose must have a start time greater than or equal to `k`.
- We want to maximize the intervals we take (without overlap), so we want to maximize our choices for the next interval.
- Because the next interval must have a start time **greater** than or equal to `k`, a larger value of `k` can **never** give us more choices than a smaller value of `k`.
- As such, we should try to minimize `k`. Therefore, we should always greedily choose `x`, since `x < y`.

> In general, `k` is equal to the end time of the most recent interval we kept.

Start by sorting `intervals` according to the end times so that we can process the intervals in order. We'll keep the variable `k` described above. 

As we iterate over the intervals, let's consider the possible cases. In the following image, `k` is the vertical line, and `x, y` is the next interval to be considered.

Because we sorted the end times, `y` must be greater than `k`. This gives us two cases: 

- Case 1, `x >= k`: we can safely take this interval because it won't cause an overlap. We should update `k = y` since this interval is now the most recent interval we are keeping.
- Case 2, `x < k`: taking this interval would cause an overlap. As we established earlier, we should always take intervals with earlier end times. Because `y > k`, we must delete the current interval (don't update `k`).

**Algorithm**

1. Sort `intervals` according to the end times.
2. Initialize an answer variable `ans = 0` and an integer `k` to represent the most recent end time. `k` should be initialized to a small value like `INT_MIN`.
3. Iterate over the intervals. For each interval:
    - If the start time is greater than or equal to `k`, update `k` to the end time of the current interval.
    - Otherwise, increment `ans`.
4. Return `ans`.

**Implementation**


```python
class Solution:
    def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        intervals.sort(key = lambda x: x[1])
        ans = 0
        k = -inf
        
        for x, y in intervals:
            if x >= k:
                # Case 1
                k = y
            else:
                # Case 2
                ans += 1
        
        return ans
```


**Complexity Analysis**

Given $$n$$ as the length of `intervals`,

* Time complexity: $$O(n \cdot \log n)$$

    We sort `intervals`, which costs $$O(n \cdot \log n)$$. Then, we iterate over the input, performing constant time work at each iteration. This means the iteration costs $$O(n)$$, which is dominated by the sort.

* Space Complexity: $$O(\log n)$$ or $$O(n)$$

    The space complexity of the sorting algorithm depends on the implementation of each programming language:
    * In Java, Arrays.sort() is implemented using a variant of the Quick Sort algorithm, which has a space complexity of $$O(\log n)$$
    * In C++, the sort() function provided by STL uses a hybrid of Quick Sort, Heap Sort and Insertion Sort, with a worst case space complexity of $$O(\log n)$$
    * In Python, the sort() function is implemented using the Timsort algorithm, which has a worst-case space complexity of $$O(n)$$
