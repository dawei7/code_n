## General
Given two strings `word1` and `word2`. You want to construct a string `merge` in the following way: while either `word1` or `word2` are non-empty, choose **one** of the following options:, the algorithm executes breadth-first search (BFS) level-order traversal using a queue. It utilizes a double-ended queue (`deque`) to support dynamic $O(1)$ push and pop operations at both ends.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(S^2)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(S)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
