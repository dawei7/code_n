## Description

There is an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled from 1 to `n`, rooted at node 1. The tree is represented by a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `u_i` and `v_i`.

Initially, all edges have a weight of 0. You must assign each edge a weight of either **1** or **2**.

The **cost** of a path between any two nodes `u` and `v` is the total weight of all edges in the path connecting them.

You are given a 2D integer array `queries`. For each `queries[i] = [u_i, v_i]`, determine the number of ways to assign weights to edges **in the path** such that the cost of the path between `u_i` and `v_i` is **odd**.

Return an array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the number of valid assignments for `queries[i]`.

Since the answer may be large, apply **modulo** `10^9 + 7` to each `answer[i]`.

**Note:** For each query, disregard all edges **not** in the path between node `u_i` and `v_i`.
