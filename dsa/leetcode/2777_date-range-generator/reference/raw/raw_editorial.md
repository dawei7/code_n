## Overview:

We need to implement a function `dateRangeGenerator` that takes a start date, end date, and a positive integer step as input and returns a generator object. The generator should yield dates in the range from start to end (inclusive), with each date differing by the specified step (in days). The given dates and the expected date format is "YYYY-MM-DD".

- **Goal:**
    - Generate dates sequentially within a specified range, including the start and end dates.
    - Control the sequence by providing a step size that determines the interval between generated dates.
    - Yield dates as strings in the YYYY-MM-DD format.

- **Key Insight:** 
    - It's imperative to closely observe and understand what the generator and yield do. Our solution hinges on the fact that it will involve looping through the date range, applying the step increment for dates, and finally yielding it.

 - **Example:**
    - Given start = "2023-04-10", end = "2023-04-20", step = 3. If we start from the date "2023-04-10" and iterate with a step of 3 days, the resulting sequence of dates would be "2023-04-10", "2023-04-13", "2023-04-16", and "2023-04-19". As we can see the process involves adding 3 days (step) to the previous date to obtain the next one in the sequence.
    ```js
    const startDate = '2023-04-10';
    const endDate = '2023-04-20';
    const step = 3;

    const generator = dateRangeGenerator(startDate, endDate, step);
    for (const date of generator) {
        console.log(date);
    }
    // Output:
    // "2023-04-10"
    // "2023-04-13"
    // "2023-04-16"
    // "2023-04-19"
    ```

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Generator functions:**  
    - Generator functions in JavaScript are special types of functions that can be paused and resumed, enabling them to yield multiple outputs on different invocations. They are defined using the `function*` keyword, and they return a generator object when invoked.
    - This generator object is special because it conforms to both the iterable and iterator protocols in JavaScript: In other words, the generator object returned by a generator function is an iterator and can be used directly in a `for...of` loop and other JavaScript constructs that expect an iterable.
    - The `yield` keyword is used within the generator function to specify the values to be returned during its execution. Each time `yield` is encountered, the function's execution is paused, and the yielded value is emitted. The next invocation of the generator's `next()` method resumes the execution from where it was last paused.
    - When a generator function is invoked, it returns a generator object, but it doesn't execute any of the function's code immediately. Instead, the function's code is executed on-demand, each time the generator's `next()` method is invoked. This feature allows the generator to maintain its position in the code for subsequent calls, effectively preserving state between these calls.
2. **Iterators vs Generators:**
    - In JavaScript, an iterator is an object that defines a sequence and potentially a return value upon its termination. Specifically, an object is an iterator when it implements a `next()` method with the following semantics:
    - On each call, it returns an object with two properties: `value` and `done`.
    - The `value` property is the `value` of the current item in the sequence.
    - The `done` property is a Boolean that is true if the last `value` in the sequence has already been produced and false otherwise.
    - In conclusion, while the terms iterator and generator are related, they are not interchangeable:
        - Iterators are a concept and a pattern that allows you to traverse sequences of values.
        - Generators are a tool that helps create iterators with a special syntax. Generators can be paused and resumed, making it easier to create complex sequences because the function "remembers" its state.

## Approach 1: Brute Force

### Intuition:
We can use a loop to iterate through the dates, from the `start` date to the `end` date. In each iteration, we'll format the date using the `Date` object, which provides methods for easy manipulation of date and time components such as setting and getting the year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and using functions like `toLocaleDateString()`, `toISOString()`, and `toUTCString()`. These formatted dates will be pushed into an array, creating a list of all the formatted dates within the given `start` and `end` dates with the specified step size.

### Algorithm:
- Convert the `startDate` and `endDate` parameters to `Date` objects.
- Initialize an empty array called `datesList` to store the formatted dates.
- Enter a while loop that continues as long as the start date is less than or equal to the end date.
   - Inside the loop, call the `formatDate` function to format the start date and push it into the `datesList` array.
     - In the `formatDate` function:
       - Get the year from the input date using the `getFullYear()` method.
       - Get the month from the input date using the `getMonth()` method and add 1 to it since the month index starts from 0. Convert it to a string and pad it with a leading zero if necessary using the `padStart()` method.
       - Get the day from the input date using the `getDate()` method. Convert it to a string and pad it with a leading zero if necessary using the `padStart()` method.
       - Concatenate the year, month, and day with hyphens to form the formatted date string.
       - Return the formatted date string.
   - Increment the start date by the specified step value using the `setDate` method.
- Return the `datesList` array.

### Implementation:


```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} start
 * @param {string} end
 * @param {number} step
 * @yields {string}
 */
var dateRangeGenerator = function(start, end, step) {
    const startDate = new Date(start);
    const endDate = new Date(end);
    const datesList = [];

    while (startDate <= endDate) {
        datesList.push(formatDate(startDate));
        startDate.setDate(startDate.getDate() + step);
    }

    return datesList;
}

// Helper function to format the date
function formatDate(date) {
    const year = date.getFullYear();
    const month = String(date.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0');
    const day = String(date.getDate()).padStart(2, '0');
    return `${year}-${month}-${day}`;
}
```



### Complexity Analysis:

* **Time complexity:** The time it takes for the loop to run depends on how many steps are needed to go from the `start` date to the `end` date with the given `step` size. This is represented as $O((end - start) / step)$, where `start` and `end` are the input dates, and `step` is the specified interval between them.

* **Space complexity:** The `datesList` array, which keeps the formatted dates, takes up most of the space. The number of dates created in the range determines the size of the array, which follows the same reasoning as the time complexity. As a result, S.C will be $O((end - start) / step)$.

## Approach 2: Using the `yield` keyword

### Intuition:
Instead of storing the required dates in a list, we can return them using the `yield` keyword. Each time the `yield` is encountered during the execution flow, the function's execution will pause, and the yielded value will be emitted. This leads to a significant enhancement in the program's performance by producing and processing values on-demand rather than precomputing and storing them in a list.

### Algorithm:
- Convert the `start` date string to a `Date` object.
- Convert the `end` date string to a `Date` object and retrieve its time value.
- While the time value of the `startDate` is less than or equal to the time value of the `endDate`:
  - Generate a date string in the format `YYYY-MM-DD` using the `startDate`.
  - Yield the generated date string.
  - Calculate the next date by adding the step to the startDate's date value.
  - Update the `startDate` with the next date.

### Implementation:


```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} start
 * @param {string} end
 * @param {number} step
 * @yields {string}
 */
var dateRangeGenerator = function*(start, end, step) {
    const startDate = new Date(start);
    const endDate = new Date(end).getTime();

    while (startDate.getTime() <= endDate) {
        const date = String(startDate.getDate()).padStart(2, '0');
        const month = String(startDate.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0');
        const year = String(startDate.getFullYear()).padStart(2, '0');
        yield `${year}-${month}-${date}`;

        const next = startDate.getDate() + step;
        startDate.setDate(next);
    }
};
```



### Complexity Analysis:

* **Time complexity:** The time it takes for the loop to run depends on how many steps are needed to go from the `start` date to the `end` date with the given `step` size. This is represented as $O((end - start) / step)$, where `start` and `end` are the input dates, and `step` is the specified interval between them.

* **Space complexity:** As the generator yields one date at a time, the space needed for storing the entire sequence of dates is constant, making the space complexity $O(1)$.

## Approach 3: Using the `ISOString` and `yield` keyword

### Intuition:
Instead of manually type-converting to a string and individually formatting each component of the date (i.e., year, month, and day), we can use the `toISOString` method from the `Date` object.

The ISO 8601 time format is used to obtain the timestamp, from which we can easily extract the date with the required format.

An ISO 8601 formatted date string follows the pattern: `$YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ$`. Where,
`YYYY` represents the year.
`MM` represents the month (01 to 12).
`DD` represents the day of the month (01 to 31).
`THH` represents the hour in 24-hour format (00 to 23).
`mm` represents the minutes (00 to 59).
`ss` represents the seconds (00 to 59).
`sss` represents milliseconds.
`Z` represents the time zone offset in the format `±hh:mm` or `Z` for UTC.

### Algorithm:
- Convert the `start` and `end` strings into `Date` objects.
- Initialize a loop that continues as long as the `startDate` is less than or equal to the `endDate`.
  - Yield the current `startDate` as a string in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.
  - Increment the `startDate` by the `step` number of days.
- Repeat the above two steps until the `startDate` is greater than the `endDate`.

### Implementation:


```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} start
 * @param {string} end
 * @param {number} step
 * @yields {string}
 */
var dateRangeGenerator = function* (start, end, step) {
    const startDate = new Date(start);
    const endDate = new Date(end);

    while (startDate <= endDate) {
        yield startDate.toISOString().split('T')[0].trim();
        startDate.setDate(startDate.getDate() + step);
    }
};
```


### Complexity Analysis:

* **Time complexity:** The time it takes for the loop to run depends on how many steps are needed to go from the `start` date to the `end` date with the given `step` size. This is represented as $O((end - start) / step)$, where `start` and `end` are the input dates, and `step` is the specified interval between them.

## Interview Tips:

<details><summary><b>Why is the output format a generator object, and what is the purpose of using a generator function?</b></summary>
<ul>
    <li>The output format being a generator object is advantageous for scenarios where generating the entire sequence of dates upfront would consume a significant amount of memory. A generator function allows lazy evaluation, meaning it produces values on the fly as they are needed. This is particularly beneficial when dealing with large date ranges, as it conserves memory by only generating dates as they are requested.</li>
    <li>The generator function, as opposed to a regular function returning a list, provides an iterator that produces values one at a time through the yield keyword. This not only saves memory but also allows for more efficient processing, especially in scenarios where you might not need the entire sequence of dates at once.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details><summary><b>How would you handle time zones in this date generation process?</b></summary>
<ul>
    <li>To handle time zones, you could modify the generator function to accept a time zone parameter. Users could then specify the desired time zone for the output dates. If no time zone is specified, you might default to a specific time zone or UTC. This flexibility allows users to generate dates adjusted to different time zones based on their specific needs.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details><summary><b>How would your solution behave in a scenario where multiple generators are created concurrently, each iterating over different date ranges?</b></summary>
<ul>
    <li>Generator functions maintain their state between invocations. Each generator instance has its own state, so if multiple generators are created concurrently, each generator maintains its position in the sequence independently. This behavior makes generators suitable for parallel processing scenarios, as they won't interfere with each other's state.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details><summary><b>Explain how generator functions in JavaScript maintain state across multiple invocations. What happens to local variables between yields?</b></summary>
<ul>
    <li>Generator functions maintain state between invocations by pausing and resuming their execution. When a generator encounters a yield statement, it suspends its state, allowing it to be resumed later. Local variables between yield statements are preserved, enabling the generator to resume execution from where it left off.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details><summary><b>Explain how you can create a pipeline of generators, where the output of one generator serves as the input for another. Discuss the benefits and potential use cases of such generator pipelines.</b></summary>
<ul>
    <li>Generator pipelines involve chaining multiple generators to process data sequentially. This can lead to a more modular and reusable code structure. For example, you might have one generator for data filtering, another for mapping, and a final one for reducing, creating a clear and composable data processing pipeline.</li>
</ul>
