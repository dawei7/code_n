## Description

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`.

In one operation, you can replace the character at any position with the next or previous letter in the alphabet (wrapping around so that `'a'` is after `'z'`). For example, replacing `'a'` with the next letter results in `'b'`, and replacing `'a'` with the previous letter results in `'z'`. Similarly, replacing `'z'` with the next letter results in `'a'`, and replacing `'z'` with the previous letter results in `'y'`.

Return the length of the **longest <span data-keyword="palindrome-string">palindromic</span> <span data-keyword="subsequence-string-nonempty">subsequence</span>** of `s` that can be obtained after performing **at most** `k` operations.
