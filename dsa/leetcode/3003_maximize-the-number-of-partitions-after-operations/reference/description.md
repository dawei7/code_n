## Description

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`.

First, you are allowed to change **at most** **one** index in `s` to another lowercase English letter.

After that, do the following partitioning operation until `s` is **empty**:

<ul>
	<li>Choose the **longest** **prefix** of `s` containing at most `k` **distinct** characters.</li>
	<li>**Delete** the prefix from `s` and increase the number of partitions by one. The remaining characters (if any) in `s` maintain their initial order.</li>
</ul>

Return an integer denoting the **maximum** number of resulting partitions after the operations by optimally choosing at most one index to change.
