### Approach 1: Heap/Priority Queue

**Intuition**

For each `person` in `people`, we need to find how many flower ranges `[start, end]` contain `person`. An intuitive first step is to sort both input arrays so that we can process both `flowers` and `people` in chronological order.

For the first `person` (in terms of arrival time), we can find all the flowers that have `start` less than `person` - these are the flowers that have started blooming before `person` arrived, and thus `person` might have a chance of seeing them. Of those flowers, we remove the ones that have `end` less than `person` as well, as these are the flowers that have finished blooming, and `person` missed them. The number of remaining flowers is the answer for the first `person`. Note that because we sorted `people`, the flowers we remove here are guaranteed never to be seen again and therefore will not affect anyone else after `person`.

Let's move to the second `person`. Once again, we find all the flowers that have `start` less than `person`. But do we need to start from scratch? No! Because we are processing both the `flowers` and `people` in order, we can start from where we left off with the previous person. More specifically, because the second person's arrival time is greater than or equal to the previous person's, the flowers that bloom before the previous person must also bloom before the second person, so there's no need for us to handle this portion of flowers again. Therefore, we will add all the flowers that have `start` less than the second `person`, starting after the last flower we took.

Similarly, the flowers that the previous person missed are definitely also missed by the second person, so there's no need for us to handle this portion of removed flowers again. Once we have taken all the flowers with `start` less than `person`, we can simply remove all the flowers that have `end` less than `person`. The number of remaining flowers is the answer for the second `person`.

We can continue this process for each `person`. To find the flowers with `start` less than a given `person`, we can use a pointer `i` that starts at `0`. We will move `i` along the `flowers` array and never decrement or reset it. This allows us to pick up where we left off for each successive `person`.

How can we remove the flowers that have `end` less than a given `person`? This one is trickier because we can only sort `flowers` by one dimension. To use the pointer technique we just described, we must sort by the `start` times. Thus, the `end` times are not necessarily in order. For example, you could have `flowers` like this:

`[2, 9], [3, 6]`

In this case, using another pointer like `j` for the end times would not work since `9` is greater than `6` but comes earlier in the input.

As we are concerned with the flowers that have earlier end times, we can use a heap/priority queue to keep track of which flowers finish blooming. We will maintain a min `heap` and push `end` times of flowers onto this `heap`. Once we have added all flowers with `start` less than `person`, we will pop from the `heap` as long as the top of it is less than `person`.

After popping from `heap`, it will hold the end times of all flowers that `person` can see. Thus, the answer for `person` is simply the size of the heap.

> To summarize, we use a pointer `i` to iterate along `flowers`. For a given `person`, we find all the flowers that started blooming before `person` arrives. We push the `end` time of these flowers onto a `heap`. We can then remove all the flowers that finished blooming by popping from the `heap`, since a min `heap` efficiently gives us the minimum (earliest) times.
>
> As we sort both input arrays, flowers that we pop from `heap` will never be seen again by future people.

A note on implementation: here, we are sorting `people`, but the problem description asks us for the answer according to the original order. We will use a hash map that maps a `person` to the number of flowers they see. We will also keep the original order of `people` by creating a copy of it to sort. Once we have calculated the answer for everyone in the sorted order, we can iterate through the original `people` and refer to the hash map to build the final answer by restoring their original order.

**Algorithm**

1. Sort `flowers`. Create a sorted version of `people` called `sortedPeople`.
2. Initialize a hash map `dic`, a min `heap`, and an integer `i = 0`.
3. Iterate over `sortedPeople`. For each `person`:
    - While `flowers[i][0] < person` (the flower at `i` already started blooming), push `flowers[i][1]` (when the flower finishes blooming) to `heap` and increment `i`.
    - While the top of `heap` (minimum element) is less than `person`, pop from `heap`.
    - Set `dic[person]` to the size of `heap`.
4. Initialize an array `ans`. Iterate over `people` and populate `ans` using `dic`.

**Implementation**


```python
class Solution:
    def fullBloomFlowers(self, flowers: List[List[int]], people: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        flowers.sort()
        sorted_people = sorted(people)
        dic = {}
        heap = []
        
        i = 0
        for person in sorted_people:
            while i < len(flowers) and flowers[i][0] <= person:
                heapq.heappush(heap, flowers[i][1])
                i += 1
            
            while heap and heap[0] < person:
                heapq.heappop(heap)
            
            dic[person] = len(heap)

        return [dic[x] for x in people]
```


**Complexity Analysis**

Given $$n$$ as the length of `flowers` and $$m$$ as the length of `people`,

* Time complexity: $$O(n \cdot \log{}n + m \cdot (\log{}n + \log{}m))$$

    We start by sorting both `flowers` and `people`. This costs $$O(n \cdot \log{}n)$$ and $$O(m \cdot \log{}m)$$ respectively. Next, we perform $$O(m)$$ iterations. At each iteration, we perform some heap operations. The cost of these operations is dependent on the size of the heap. Our heap cannot exceed a size of $$n$$, so these operations cost $$O(\log{}n)$$.

    There are some other linear time operations that don't affect our time complexity. In total, our time complexity is $$O(n \cdot \log{}n + m \cdot (\log{}n + \log{}m))$$.

* Space complexity: $$O(n + m)$$

    We create an array `sortedPeople` of length $$m$$. `dic` also grows to a length of $$m$$, and `heap` can grow to a size of $$O(n)$$.

### Approach 2: Difference Array + Binary Search

**Intuition**

There is a technique called difference array that can be used to solve many "range" based problems. The technique involves creating an array `difference` and iterating over all ranges `[start, end]`. We perform `difference[start]++` and `difference[end + 1]--` for each range.

The idea is that each index of `difference` represents the **change** in the number of flowers we can see when we cross this index (not the actual number of flowers on this index), with each index representing a unit of time. Thus, we could take a `prefix` sum of this `difference` array to find how many flowers can be seen at any given time with `prefix[time]`.

> Some people also call this technique "line sweep".

Unfortunately, if we look at the constraints, we find that values of `start, end, people` can be up to $$10^9$$. It would not be feasible to create an array with such a large size. Thus, we need to use a map structure instead. Like in the previous approach, we still want to process everything chronologically. We will use the following data structures:

- In Java, we will use `TreeMap`.
- In C++, we will use `std::map`.
- In Python, we will use `sortedcontainers.SortedDict`.

> Note that if you were not allowed to use these structures in an interview, you could still implement this approach using a normal hash map. You would just need to sort the elements in the hash map by key values after you populated it.

Once we have this data structure `difference`, we will follow the process described above. We iterate over each `flower = [start, end]` and increment `difference[start]` while decrementing `difference[end + 1]`. The idea is that when we reach `start`, the number of flowers we see increases by one. When we reach `end + 1`, the number of flowers we see decreases by one.

We then create a `prefix` sum of the values in `difference`. We also need to know what time each value is associated with, so we will create an array `positions` to go along with our `prefix` array. Here, `prefix[i]` is the number of flowers available at time `positions[i]`.

Finally, we can iterate over `people` and find the answer for each `person`. How do we do this? We can perform a binary search over `positions` to find the index `i` where `person` fits. `prefix[i]` is the answer for this `person`.

Let's summarize the algorithm with an example:

![example](images/1.png)
<br>

Our first step is to populate `difference`. Each `key, value` pair in `difference` represents "at time `key`, we see a change in `value` new flowers". For example, the key value pair of `6: -2` means that at time `6`, we see two less flowers.

![example](images/2.png)
<br>

Next, we create a `prefix` sum on the values of difference, as well as an array `positions` to associate each `prefix` value with a position in time. Notice that `positions` is just the keys of `difference`.

![example](images/3.png)
<br>

With these arrays, we can now use binary search to identify how many flowers a given `person` will see. For example, consider `person` at time `7`:

![example](images/4.png)
<br>

What about `person` at time `11`?

![example](images/5.png)
<br>

There are a few more things to consider before we start implementation.

1. What happens if there is a `person` that arrives before any flower blooms? This may confuse our binary search since the minimum value in `positions` will be greater than `person`. We will initialize `difference` with `0: 0` to represent at time `0`, we don't see any new flowers.
2. Regarding the binary search; how should it be configured? Referencing the above example images, inserting `11` into the given `positions` array will put it at index `6`. However, we need index `5`. Thus, we need the insertion index minus one. What if the value exists in `positions`, as is the case with `person = 7`? To offset the minus one, we will binary search for the rightmost insertion index (`bisect_right` in Python, `upper_bound` in C++).

**Algorithm**

1. Initialize a sorted-map data structure `difference` with `0: 0`.
2. Iterate over each `flower = [start, end]` in `flowers`:
    - Increment `difference[start]`.
    - Decrement `difference[end + 1]`.
3. Initialize two arrays, `positions` and `prefix`. Iterate over the keys of `difference`:
    - `positions` contains all the keys in the order they are traversed.
    - `prefix` contains the prefix sum of the corresponding values.
4. Initialize the answer array `ans`. Iterate over each `person` in `people`:
    - Perform a right-insertion index binary search on `positions` with `person`.
    - Calculate `i` as the result of this binary search minus one.
    - Add `prefix[i]` to `ans`.
5. Return `ans`.

**Implementation**


```python
from sortedcontainers import SortedDict

class Solution:
    def fullBloomFlowers(self, flowers: List[List[int]], people: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        difference = SortedDict({0: 0})
        for start, end in flowers:
            difference[start] = difference.get(start, 0) + 1
            difference[end + 1] = difference.get(end + 1, 0) - 1
        
        positions = []
        prefix = []
        curr = 0
        for key, val in difference.items():
            positions.append(key)
            curr += val
            prefix.append(curr)

        ans = []
        for person in people:
            i = bisect_right(positions, person) - 1
            ans.append(prefix[i])
        
        return ans
```


**Complexity Analysis**

Given $$n$$ as the length of `flowers` and $$m$$ as the length of `people`,

* Time complexity: $$O((n + m) \cdot \log{n})$$

    Our first loop sets `difference`, which costs $$O(n \cdot \log{}n)$$.
    
    Next, we calculate the prefix sum, which will cost either $$O(n)$$ or $$O(n \cdot \log{}n)$$ depending on your language's implementation. This is because `difference` will have a size between $$n$$ and $$2n$$.
    
    Finally, we have a loop over `people`. We perform a binary search that costs $$O(\log{}n)$$ at each iteration. Thus, we spend $$m \cdot \log{}n$$ here.

    This gives us a final time complexity of $$O((n + m) \cdot \log{n})$$

* Space complexity: $$O(n)$$

    `difference` has a size of $$O(n)$$. `prefix` and `positions` have the same size as `difference`.

### Approach 3: Simpler Binary Search

**Intuition**

In the previous approach, we used the concept of a difference array/line sweep to calculate how many flowers are seen at a given time. For each `flower = [start, end]`, we indicated that at time `start`, we see one more flower, and at time `end + 1`, we see one less flower. We identified when a flower started blooming and when it finished blooming.

The idea behind this strategy is that at any given time, **the number of flowers we see is the number of flowers that have already started blooming minus the amount of flowers have finished blooming.**

Is there a simpler way to identify at a given time, how many flowers have started blooming, and how many flowers have finished blooming? In the first two approaches, we always associate the `start` and `end` of the same flower together for processing, which is more intuitive but can be more complex to handle. What if we separately consider these two sets of times?

We can simply collect all `start` points in one array `starts`, sort it, and then perform a binary search. We can do the exact same thing with another array `ends` for all `end` points. Take a look at the following example:

![example](images/6.png)
<br>

Here, we have collected all `start` and `end` times and then sorted them. How many flowers can somebody at time `11` see?

![example](images/7.png)
<br>

As you can see, `4` flowers have started blooming and `2` flowers have finished blooming. Thus, `4 - 2 = 2` flowers can be seen at time `11`. Because `starts` and `ends` is sorted, we can use binary search to quickly identify how many flowers have started and finished blooming for any given time.

Regarding the binary searches: when binary searching on `starts`, we want to search for the rightmost insertion index. This is because if a `person` arrives at the same time as a flower starts blooming, we want to include this flower.

Note that a `flower = [start, end]` stops blooming at `end + 1`, not `end`. There are two ways we can handle this. We can either binary search on `end` for the leftmost insertion index (since we want to include all flowers with `end` equal to the current time), or we can assemble `ends` using `end + 1` for each `flower`. We will implement the algorithm using the second option in this article.

**Algorithm**

1. Create two arrays `starts` and `ends`.
2. Iterate over each `flower = [start, end]` in `flowers`:
    - Add `start` to `starts`.
    - Add `end + 1` to `ends`.
3. Sort both `starts` and `ends`.
4. Initialize the answer array `ans` and iterate over each `person` in `people`:
    - Perform a binary search on `starts` for the rightmost insertion index of `person` to find `i`.
    - Perform a binary search on `ends` for the rightmost insertion index of `person` to find `j`.
    - Add `i - j` to `ans`.
5. Return `ans`.

**Implementation**


```python
class Solution:
    def fullBloomFlowers(self, flowers: List[List[int]], people: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        starts = []
        ends = []
        
        for start, end in flowers:
            starts.append(start)
            ends.append(end + 1)
            
        starts.sort()
        ends.sort()
        ans = []

        for person in people:
            i = bisect_right(starts, person)
            j = bisect_right(ends, person)
            ans.append(i - j)
        
        return ans
```


**Complexity Analysis**

Given $$n$$ as the length of `flowers` and $$m$$ as the length of `people`,

* Time complexity: $$O((n + m) \cdot \log{n})$$

    We first create two arrays of length $$n$$, `starts` and `ends`, then sort them. This costs $$O(n \cdot \log{}n)$$.

    Next, we iterate over `people` and perform two binary searches at each iteration. This costs $$O(m \cdot \log{}n)$$.

    Thus, our time complexity is $$O((n + m) \cdot \log{n})$$.

* Space complexity: $$O(n)$$

    `starts` and `ends` both have a size of `n`.
