## General
Given an integer `n` and an integer `p` representing an array `arr` of length `n` where all elements are set to 0's, except position `p` which is set to 1. You are also given an integer array `banned` containing restricted ..., the algorithm executes breadth-first search (BFS) level-order traversal using a queue. It utilizes a double-ended queue (`deque`) to support dynamic $O(1)$ push and pop operations at both ends. Edge case handling: applies modulo arithmetic to prevent integer overflow.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n\alpha(n))$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(n)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
