### Approach: Mathematics

#### Intuition

Let the sum of the elements in the array $\text{nums}$ be $\textit{sum}$, and let the sums of the two non-empty subarrays be $x$ and $y$, respectively. Clearly, $x + y = \textit{sum}$.

- If $\textit{sum}$ is odd, then either $x$ is odd and $y$ is even, or $x$ is even and $y$ is odd, so $x - y$ is odd.

- If $\textit{sum}$ is even, then either both $x$ and $y$ are odd or both are even, so $x - y$ is even.

From this, let $n$ be the number of elements in $\textit{nums}$. When $\textit{sum}$ is even, the number of partitioning schemes with an even difference is $n - 1$. When $\textit{sum}$ is odd, the number of such schemes is $0$.

#### Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def countPartitions(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        totalSum = sum(nums)
        return len(nums) - 1 if totalSum % 2 == 0 else 0
```

#### Complexity Analysis

Let $n$ be the length of $\textit{nums}$.

- Time complexity: $O(n)$.

- Space complexity: $O(1)$.
