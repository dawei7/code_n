## Description

You are given a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of the characters `'A'` and `'B'`.

You are also given a 2D integer array `queries` of length `q`, where each `queries[i]` is one of the following:

<ul>
	<li>`[1, j]`: **Flip** the character at index `j` of `s` i.e. `'A'` changes to `'B'` (and vice versa). This operation mutates `s` and affects subsequent queries.</li>
	<li>`[2, l, r]`: **Compute** the **minimum** number of character deletions required to make the **substring** `s[l..r]` **alternating**. This operation does not modify `s`; the length of `s` remains `n`.</li>
</ul>

A **<span data-keyword="substring-nonempty">substring</span>** is **alternating** if no two **adjacent** characters are **equal**. A substring of length 1 is always alternating.

Return an integer array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the result of the `i^th` query of type `[2, l, r]`.
