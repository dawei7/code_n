## General
Given an undirected tree consisting of `n` vertices numbered from `1` to `n`. A frog starts jumping from **vertex 1**. In one second, the frog jumps from its current vertex to another **unvisited** vertex if they are direct..., the algorithm executes breadth-first search (BFS) level-order traversal using a queue. It utilizes a hash map (`dict`) to store element values and their indices/frequencies for $O(1)$ fast access, a double-ended queue (`deque`) to support dynamic $O(1)$ push and pop operations at both ends. Edge case handling: guards against empty/null inputs via early returns.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(n)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
