## General
Given There is an `m x n` grid with a ball. The ball is initially at the position `[startRow, startColumn]`. You are allowed to move the ball to one of the four adjacent cells in the grid (possibly out of the grid crossing ..., the algorithm executes a single-pass linear scan through input elements. It utilizes a dynamic programming memoization table to cache intermediate subproblem states. Edge case handling: applies modulo arithmetic to prevent integer overflow.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(m n maxMove)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(m n)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
