## Description

You are given an `m x n` grid where each cell contains one of the values 0, 1, or 2. You are also given an integer `k`.

You start from the top-left corner `(0, 0)` and want to reach the bottom-right corner `(m - 1, n - 1)` by moving only **right** or **down**.

Each cell contributes a specific score and incurs an associated cost, according to their cell values:

<ul>
	<li>0: adds 0 to your score and costs 0.</li>
	<li>1: adds 1 to your score and costs 1.</li>
	<li>2: adds 2 to your score and costs 1. ​​​​​​​</li>
</ul>

Return the **maximum** score achievable without exceeding a total cost of `k`, or -1 if no valid path exists.

**Note:** If you reach the last cell but the total cost exceeds `k`, the path is invalid.
