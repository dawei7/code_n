## General
Given a **valid** boolean expression as a string `expression` consisting of the characters `'1'`,`'0'`,`'&'` (bitwise **AND** operator),`'|'` (bitwise **OR** operator),`'('`, and `')'`, the algorithm executes a two-pointer approach to shrink boundaries or maintain a sliding window. It utilizes a dynamic programming memoization table to cache intermediate subproblem states. Key operations include bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`) for fast bitmask state updates.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(N)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(N)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
