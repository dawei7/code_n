## General
**Competitive Approach — Design Most Recently Used Queue**

The solution employs Breadth-First Search (BFS) using queue-based level-order traversal. It utilizes Double-ended queue (`collections.deque`) for efficient $O(1)$ element insertion and removal to maintain optimal runtime bounds. Key implementation techniques include Bitwise manipulation (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`) for fast bitmask state updates.

**Why This Approach Was Chosen:**
Sourced from `kamyu104/LeetCode-Solutions`. This implementation focuses on raw computational throughput in method `__init__`. It minimizes object instantiation overhead, avoids redundant memory passes, and leverages compact iteration loops.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(\sqrt{n})$ — Operation count proportional to input scale.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(n)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.

## Alternatives and edge cases
- **Micro-Optimization:** Eliminates unnecessary function calls and temporary allocations to maximize execution speed.
- **Low Constant Factor:** Uses tight loop bounds and direct indexing for optimal judge performance.
