## General
Given the string `croakOfFrogs`, which represents a combination of the string `"croak"` from different frogs, that is, multiple frogs can croak at the same time, so multiple `"croak"` are mixed, the algorithm executes a single-pass linear scan through input elements. Edge case handling: guards against empty/null inputs via early returns, applies modulo arithmetic to prevent integer overflow.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
