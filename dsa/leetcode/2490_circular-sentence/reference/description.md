## Description

A **sentence** is a list of words that are separated by a** single** space with no leading or trailing spaces.

<ul>
	<li>For example, `"Hello World"`, `"HELLO"`, `"hello world hello world"` are all sentences.</li>
</ul>

Words consist of **only** uppercase and lowercase English letters. Uppercase and lowercase English letters are considered different.

A sentence is **circular **if:

<ul>
	<li>The last character of each word in the sentence is equal to the first character of its next word.</li>
	<li>The last character of the last word is equal to the first character of the first word.</li>
</ul>

For example, `"leetcode exercises sound delightful"`, `"eetcode"`, `"leetcode eats soul" `are all circular sentences. However, `"Leetcode is cool"`, `"happy Leetcode"`, `"Leetcode"` and `"I like Leetcode"` are **not** circular sentences.

Given a string `sentence`, return `true`* if it is circular*. Otherwise, return `false`.
