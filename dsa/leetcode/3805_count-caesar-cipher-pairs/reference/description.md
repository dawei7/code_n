## Description

You are given an array `words` of `n` strings. Each string has length `m` and contains only lowercase English letters.

Two strings `s` and `t` are **similar** if we can apply the following operation any number of times (possibly zero times) so that `s` and `t` become **equal**.

<ul>
	<li>Choose either `s` or `t`.</li>
	<li>Replace **every** letter in the chosen string with the next letter in the alphabet cyclically. The next letter after `'z'` is `'a'`.</li>
</ul>

Count the number of pairs of indices `(i, j)` such that:

<ul>
	<li>`i < j`</li>
	<li>`words[i]` and `words[j]` are **similar**.</li>
</ul>

Return an integer denoting the number of such pairs.
