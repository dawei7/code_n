### Approach: Sort

**Intuition**

Without loss of generality, say the sidelengths of the triangle are $a \leq b \leq c$.  The necessary and sufficient condition for these lengths to form a triangle of non-zero area is $a + b > c$.

Say we knew $c$ already.  There is no reason not to choose the largest possible $a$ and $b$ from the array.  If $a + b > c$, then it forms a triangle, otherwise it doesn't.

**Algorithm**

This leads to a simple algorithm:  Sort the array.  For any $c$ in the array, we choose the largest possible $a \leq b \leq c$:  these are just the two values adjacent to $c$.  If this forms a triangle, we return the answer.

```python
class Solution:
    def largestPerimeter(self, A):
        A.sort()
        for i in range(len(A) - 3, -1, -1):
            if A[i] + A[i + 1] > A[i + 2]:
                return A[i] + A[i + 1] + A[i + 2]
        return 0
```

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $O(N \log N)$, where $N$ is the length of `A`.

* Space Complexity:
* **Java (code uses `Arrays.sort`)**: $O(\log N)$)$ auxiliary space due to recursion stack in the dual-pivot quicksort used for primitive arrays.

* **Python (`list.sort()` / `A.sort()`)**: $O(N)$ extra space in the worst case because TimSort may allocate temporary buffers proportional to the input size. Everything after the sort is $O(1)$ space.

* **C++ (`std::sort`)**: $O(\log N)$ auxiliary space due to recursion depth in Introsort (a hybrid of quicksort, heapsort, and insertion sort). Sorting is otherwise in-place.
