## General
Given A `3 x 3` **magic square** is a `3 x 3` grid filled with distinct numbers **from **1** to **9 such that each row, column, and both diagonals all have the same sum, the algorithm executes a single-pass linear scan through input elements. It utilizes a hash set (`set`) to track unique elements and prevent duplicate processing in $O(1)$ time. Edge case handling: guards against empty/null inputs via early returns.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(rc)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
