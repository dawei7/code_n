## Description

Alice frequently takes exams and wants to track her scores and calculate the total scores over specific time periods.

Implement the `ExamTracker` class:

<ul>
	<li>`ExamTracker()`: Initializes the `ExamTracker` object.</li>
	<li>`void record(int time, int score)`: Alice takes a new exam at time `time` and achieves the score `score`.</li>
	<li>`long long totalScore(int startTime, int endTime)`: Returns an integer that represents the **total** score of all exams taken by Alice between `startTime` and `endTime` (inclusive). If there are no recorded exams taken by Alice within the specified time interval, return 0.</li>
</ul>

It is guaranteed that the function calls are made in chronological order. That is,

<ul>
	<li>Calls to `record()` will be made with **strictly increasing** `time`.</li>
	<li>Alice will never ask for total scores that require information from the future. That is, if the latest `record()` is called with `time = t`, then `totalScore()` will always be called with `startTime <= endTime <= t`.</li>
</ul>
