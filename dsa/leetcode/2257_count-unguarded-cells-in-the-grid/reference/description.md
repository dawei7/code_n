## Description

You are given two integers `m` and `n` representing a **0-indexed** `m x n` grid. You are also given two 2D integer arrays `guards` and `walls` where `guards[i] = [row_i, col_i]` and `walls[j] = [row_j, col_j]` represent the positions of the `i^th` guard and `j^th` wall respectively.

A guard can see **every** cell in the four cardinal directions (north, east, south, or west) starting from their position unless **obstructed** by a wall or another guard. A cell is **guarded** if there is **at least** one guard that can see it.

Return* the number of unoccupied cells that are **not** **guarded**.*
