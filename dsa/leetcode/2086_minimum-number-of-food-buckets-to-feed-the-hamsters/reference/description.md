## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** string `hamsters` where `hamsters[i]` is either:

<ul>
	<li>`'H'` indicating that there is a hamster at index `i`, or</li>
	<li>`'.'` indicating that index `i` is empty.</li>
</ul>

You will add some number of food buckets at the empty indices in order to feed the hamsters. A hamster can be fed if there is at least one food bucket to its left or to its right. More formally, a hamster at index `i` can be fed if you place a food bucket at index `i - 1` **and/or** at index `i + 1`.

Return *the minimum number of food buckets you should **place at empty indices** to feed all the hamsters or *`-1`* if it is impossible to feed all of them*.
