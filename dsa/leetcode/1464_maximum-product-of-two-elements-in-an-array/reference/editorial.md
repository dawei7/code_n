### Approach 1: Brute Force

**Intuition**

To start, we will simply check every pair of indices `(i, j)` and calculate $(\text{nums}[i] - 1) * (\text{nums}[j] - 1)$. We will take the maximum value as the answer.

Note that a pair of indices `(i, j)` will have the same result as `(j, i)`. Thus, to be more efficient, we will start iterating `j` from $i + 1$. This way, we don't check any duplicate pairs.

**Algorithm**

1. Initialize the answer $ans = 0$.
2. Iterate `i` over the indices of `nums`:
- Iterate `j` over the indices of `nums`, starting from $i + 1$:
- Calculate $(\text{nums}[i] - 1) * (\text{nums}[j] - 1)$ and update `ans` if it is larger.
3. Return `ans`.

**Implementation**

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProduct(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        ans = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
                ans = max(ans, (nums[i] - 1) * (nums[j] - 1))

        return ans
```

**Complexity Analysis**

Given $n$ as the length of `nums`,

* Time complexity: $O(n^2)$

    We have a nested for loop over the indices of `nums`. For $i = 0$, we will iterate `j` over $n$ indices. For $i = 1$, we will iterate `j` over $n - 1$ indices. For $i = 2$, we will iterate `j` over $n - 2$ indices, and so on.

    In total, we iterate `j` over $1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n$ indices. This is the partial sum of [this series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_%2B_2_%2B_3_%2B_4_%2B_%E2%8B%AF#Partial_sums), which is equal to $\frac{n \cdot (n + 1)}{2} = O(n^2)$.

* Space complexity: $O(1)$

    We aren't using any extra space.

### Approach 2: Sort

**Intuition**

Intuitively, given all the candidates are non-negative, if you wanted to maximize the product of $x * y$, you would choose the largest values for `x` and `y`.

In this problem, we need to subtract one from our numbers before multiplying them. However, this doesn't change the logic of choosing the largest numbers, since **every** element will be reduced by the same amount and will still be non-negative. Thus, it is optimal for us to choose the two largest elements.

We can sort the array to easily find the two largest elements.

**Algorithm**

1. Sort `nums` in ascending order.
2. Set `x` as the last element in `nums` and `y` as the second last element in `nums`.
3. Return $(x - 1) * (y - 1)$.

**Implementation**

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProduct(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        x = nums[-1]
        y = nums[-2]
        return (x - 1) * (y - 1)
```

**Complexity Analysis**

Given $n$ as the length of `nums`,

* Time complexity: $O(n \cdot \log{}n)$

    We sort `nums`, which costs $O(n \cdot \log{}n)$.

* Space Complexity: $O(\log n)$ or $O(n)$

    The space complexity of the sorting algorithm depends on the implementation of each programming language:
* In Java, Arrays.sort() for primitives is implemented using a variant of the Quick Sort algorithm, which has a space complexity of $O(\log n)$
* In C++, the sort() function provided by STL uses a hybrid of Quick Sort, Heap Sort and Insertion Sort, with a worst case space complexity of $O(\log n)$
* In Python, the sort() function is implemented using the Timsort algorithm, which has a worst-case space complexity of $O(n)$

### Approach 3: Track Second Biggest

**Intuition**

Without sorting, we can easily find the maximum element in `nums` by iterating over `nums` and continuously updating a variable with the largest value we see. However, we need the second largest value as well. Can we accomplish this without sorting?

We will use two variables: `biggest` to represent the biggest element we have seen so far, and `secondBiggest` to represent the second biggest element we have seen so far.

We then iterate over each `num` in `nums`. For each `num`, there are two possibilities:

1. `num > biggest`. We have found a new biggest element and should update $biggest = num$. However, before we do this, we update $secondBiggest = biggest$ since the old biggest element we saw will become the new second biggest element.
2. $num \le biggest$. We should not update `biggest`. However, `num` may be larger than `secondBiggest`, in which case it would be the new second biggest element. We update `secondBiggest` with `num` if it is larger.

After iterating over all elements, we simply return $(biggest - 1) * (secondBiggest - 1)$.

**Algorithm**

1. Initialize $biggest = 0$ and $secondBiggest = 0$.
2. Iterate over each `num` in `nums`:
- If `num > biggest`:
- Update $secondBiggest = biggest$.
- Update $biggest = num$.
- Else:
- Update `secondBiggest` with `num` if it is larger.
3. Return $(biggest - 1) * (secondBiggest - 1)$.

**Implementation**

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProduct(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        biggest = 0
        second_biggest = 0
        for num in nums:
            if num > biggest:
                second_biggest = biggest
                biggest = num
            else:
                second_biggest = max(second_biggest, num)

        return (biggest - 1) * (second_biggest - 1)
```

**Complexity Analysis**

Given $n$ as the length of `nums`,

* Time complexity: $O(n)$

    We iterate over `nums` once, performing $O(1)$ work at each iteration.

* Space complexity: $O(1)$

    We aren't using any extra space other than a few integers.
