## General
Given A **critical point** in a linked list is defined as **either** a **local maxima** or a **local minima**, the algorithm executes a single-pass linear scan through input elements. It utilizes a hash map (`dict`) to store element values and their indices/frequencies for $O(1)$ fast access, linked list node pointers (`val`, `next`) to process sequential node chains.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
