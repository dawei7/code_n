### Overview

We are given a list of equal-length strings, `words`, and a `target` string. The task is to count the number of ways we can form the `target` by selecting characters from `words`.

To construct the `target`:

- Start with the first character of `target` and find a matching character in any of the strings in `words`.
- For each subsequent character in `target`, pick characters from higher indices in the strings of `words` without revisiting previous ones.

### Approach 1: Top-down Dynamic Programming

#### Intuition

Let's say we match the first character of `target` with the first character of a `word` in words. We then move to the next character in `target` and search for it in the remaining words. This creates a subproblem where the `target` becomes shorter by one character, and the search space in `words` is reduced. We also have the option to skip the current match and search for another match in subsequent words. This branching of choices makes the problem recursive.

The recursion tracks two indices: `wordsIndex` for the position in `words` and `targetIndex` for the position in `target`.

The base cases are:
- If all characters in `target` are matched, return `1` (successful match).
- If `words` is exhausted or the remaining `target` characters exceed available `words`, return `0` (no match).

At each step, two options are explored:
1. Match the current character: If $\text{target}[targetIndex]$ matches any character in $\text{words}[wordsIndex]$, recursively proceed with the next character of `target` and the next word. Contributions from multiple matches are summed.
2. Skip the current word: Continue searching with the same `target` position but move to the next word.

This generates a recursive tree with exponential complexity in the worst case ($(\text{number of words})^{\text{target.length}}$), making it inefficient for large inputs.

However, since we have `wordsIndex` and `targetIndex` as independent states in the recursion, we can optimize the solution using memoization. The total number of states would remain limited to $\text{words.length} * \text{target.length}$. By storing the results of each state in a `dp` matrix, we can avoid redundant calculations and significantly reduce the time complexity.

#### Algorithm

Main function - `numWays(words, target)`

1. Initialize the data structures:
- Create a 2D `dp` array with dimensions `[words[0].size()][target.size()]` and initialize all values to `-1` (used for memoization).
- Create a 2D `charFrequency` array with dimensions `[words[0].size()][26]` to store the frequency of characters at each index across all words.

2. Populate the `charFrequency` matrix:
- Iterate over all the words in the `words` list.
- For each character at index `j` in each word, increment the corresponding frequency count in $\text{charFrequency}[j][character]$.

3. Call the recursive function `getWords(words, target, 0, 0, dp, charFrequency)` to calculate the number of ways to match the target string with the words matrix.

Recursive Function - `getWords(words, target, wordsIndex, targetIndex, dp, charFrequency)`

1. Base case:
- If $targetIndex = \text{target.size}()$, return `1`, indicating all characters of the target have been successfully matched.
- If $wordsIndex = \text{words}[0].size()$ or there are fewer remaining characters in words than needed by target, return `0`, indicating it's not possible to match the target.

2. Memoization check:
- If $\text{dp}[wordsIndex][targetIndex] \neq -1$, return the stored result from the `dp` array.

3. Recursive calculation:
- Initialize $countWays = 0$.
- Calculate $curPos = \text{target}[targetIndex] - 'a'$ to get the target character position.
- Two choices:
- Option 1: Do not match the current character of target with the current word at `wordsIndex`. Recursively call `getWords` with $wordsIndex + 1$ and the same `targetIndex`.
- Option 2: Match the current character of `target` with a character at `wordsIndex`. Multiply the number of valid choices at $\text{charFrequency}[wordsIndex][curPos]$ with the result of recursively calling `getWords` with $wordsIndex + 1$ and $targetIndex + 1$.

4. Store the calculated countWays in $\text{dp}[wordsIndex][targetIndex]$, modulo $1000000007$ to avoid overflow.

5. Return the value stored in $\text{dp}[wordsIndex][targetIndex]$.

#### Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def numWays(self, words, target):

        dp = [[-1] * len(target) for _ in range(len(words[0]))]
        char_frequency = [[0] * 26 for _ in range(len(words[0]))]

        # Store the frequency of every character at every index.
        for i in range(len(words)):
            for j in range(len(words[0])):
                character = ord(words[i][j]) - 97
                char_frequency[j][character] += 1
        return self.__get_words(words, target, 0, 0, dp, char_frequency)

    def __get_words(
        self, words, target, words_index, target_index, dp, char_frequency
    ):
        if target_index == len(target):
            return 1
        if (
            words_index == len(words[0])
            or len(words[0]) - words_index < len(target) - target_index
        ):
            return 0

        if dp[words_index][target_index] != -1:
            return dp[words_index][target_index]

        count_ways = 0
        cur_pos = ord(target[target_index]) - 97
        # Don't match any character of target with any word.
        count_ways += self.__get_words(
            words, target, words_index + 1, target_index, dp, char_frequency
        )
        # Multiply the number of choices with getWords and add it to count.
        count_ways += char_frequency[words_index][cur_pos] * self.__get_words(
            words, target, words_index + 1, target_index + 1, dp, char_frequency
        )

        dp[words_index][target_index] = count_ways % 1000000007
        return dp[words_index][target_index]
```

#### Complexity Analysis

Let $\text{totalWords}$ be the total number of words in the `words` matrix, and $\text{wordLength}$ and $\text{targetLength}$ represent the length of any word in `words` and the `target` string, respectively.

- Time Complexity: $O(wordLength \cdot targetLength + wordLength \cdot totalWords)$

    We first calculate the frequency of characters in the `words` matrix, which takes $O(wordLength \cdot totalWords)$ time.

    The `getWords` function is called recursively for each combination of `word` index and `target` index, leading to $O(wordLength \cdot targetLength)$ recursive calls. Each call involves constant-time operations, and memoization ensures that each combination is computed once, making the recursion time complexity $O(wordLength \cdot targetLength)$.

    Thus, the total time complexity is $O(wordLength \cdot targetLength + wordLength \cdot totalWords)$.

- Space Complexity: $O(wordLength \cdot targetLength)$

    The space complexity is dominated by two factors:

- Memoization (`dp` table): The dp table stores the intermediate results for every combination of `wordIndex` and `targetIndex`. This table has dimensions of `wordLength x targetLength`, so its space complexity is $O(wordLength \cdot targetLength)$.

- Character Frequency Matrix (`charFrequency`): The `charFrequency` matrix stores the frequency of each character at each column of the `words` matrix. This matrix has dimensions of `wordLength x 26`, where 26 corresponds to the number of possible characters (assuming lowercase English letters), resulting in a space complexity of $O(wordLength \cdot 26)$, which simplifies to $O(wordLength)$.

    Combining both, the overall space complexity is given by $O(wordLength \cdot targetLength + wordLength) \approx O(wordLength \cdot targetLength)$.

### Approach 2: Bottom-up Dynamic Programming

#### Intuition

Tabulation is a dynamic programming technique that iteratively computes solutions for all combinations of parameters. Unlike memoization, it avoids recursive stack overhead by using a iterative way, making it more efficient. We have two variables that change as we progress through the matrix: the current word index (`currWord`) and the current `target` string index (`currTarget`). To thoroughly explore the combinations, we use two nested loops to iterate through these variables.

First, we establish the base case: if `currTarget` is `0`, then $\text{dp}[currWord][0] = 1$, meaning there is exactly one way to form an empty `target` string, regardless of the number of columns in `words`.

Now to achieve the goal we will fill the DP table with two main steps:

1. Skip the current column of `words`:
   Carry over the value from the previous row: $\text{dp}[currWord][currTarget] = dp[currWord - 1][currTarget]$
2. Include the current character if it matches:
   If $target[currTarget - 1]$ matches a character in the current column of `words`, add its contribution: $\text{dp}[currWord][currTarget] += \text{charFrequency}[currWord - 1][\text{target}[currTarget - 1] - 'a'] \cdot dp[currWord - 1][currTarget - 1]$

Finally, we take the result modulo $10^9 + 7$ at every step to prevent overflow.

At the end, the total number of ways to form the `target` string is stored in $\text{dp}[wordLength][targetLength]$.

#### Algorithm

1. Create a 2D array `charFrequency` of size `wordLength x 26` to store the frequency of each character at every index in `words`.
2. Fill `charFrequency` by iterating over each string in `words`:
   - For each string, increment the count of the respective character for the corresponding column.
3. Initialize a DP table `dp` of size $(wordLength + 1) x (targetLength + 1)$ and set all values to `0`.
4. Set the base case:
   - For all `currWord` from `0` to `wordLength`, set $\text{dp}[currWord][0] = 1$.
5. Iterate `currWord` from `1` to `wordLength`:
   - Iterate `currTarget` from `1` to `targetLength`:
     - Set $\text{dp}[currWord][currTarget] = dp[currWord - 1][currTarget]$.
     - If the character at $target[currTarget - 1]$ matches a character in `words` at $currWord - 1$, add the contribution:
       $\text{dp}[currWord][currTarget] += charFrequency[currWord - 1][target[currTarget - 1] - 'a'] * dp[currWord - 1][currTarget - 1]$
     - Apply modulo $10^{9} + 7$ to prevent overflow.
6. Return the value in $\text{dp}[wordLength][targetLength]$.

#### Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def numWays(self, words: List[str], target: str) -> int:
        word_length = len(words[0])
        target_length = len(target)
        mod = 1000000007

        # Step 1: Calculate frequency of each character at every index in
        # "words".
        char_frequency = [[0] * 26 for _ in range(word_length)]
        for word in words:
            for j in range(word_length):
                char_frequency[j][ord(word[j]) - ord("a")] += 1

        # Step 2: Initialize a DP table.
        dp = [[0] * (target_length + 1) for _ in range(word_length + 1)]

        # Base case: There is one way to form an empty target string.
        for curr_word in range(word_length + 1):
            dp[curr_word][0] = 1

        # Step 3: Fill the DP table.
        for curr_word in range(1, word_length + 1):
            for curr_target in range(1, target_length + 1):
                # Carry over the previous value (not using this index of
                # "words").
                dp[curr_word][curr_target] = dp[curr_word - 1][curr_target]

                # Add ways using the current index of "words" if the characters
                # match.
                cur_pos = ord(target[curr_target - 1]) - ord("a")
                dp[curr_word][curr_target] += (
                    char_frequency[curr_word - 1][cur_pos]
* dp[curr_word - 1][curr_target - 1]
                ) % mod
                dp[curr_word][curr_target] %= mod

        # Step 4: The result is in dp[word_length][target_length].
        return dp[word_length][target_length]
```

#### Complexity Analysis

Let $\text{totalWords}$ be the total number of words in the `words` matrix, and $\text{wordLength}$ and $\text{targetLength}$ represent the length of any word in `words` and the `target` string, respectively.

- Time Complexity: $O(wordLength \cdot targetLength + wordLength \cdot totalWords)$

    To find the frequency of all the characters in the `words` matrix, we iterate through all the characters in the matrix. This takes $O(wordLength \cdot totalWords)$ time.

    The dynamic programming table `dp` is filled by iterating over each combination of `word` index and `target` index, leading to a total of $O(wordLength \cdot targetLength)$ iterations. Each iteration performs constant-time operations such as looking up values in the `charFrequency` matrix and updating the `dp` table.

    Therefore, the total time complexity is given by $O(wordLength \cdot targetLength + wordLength \cdot totalWords)$.

- Space Complexity: $O(wordLength \cdot targetLength)$

    The space complexity is dominated by two factors:

- `dp` table: The `dp` table stores the intermediate results for every combination of `wordIndex` and `targetIndex`. This table has dimensions of `wordLength x targetLength`, so its space complexity is $O(wordLength \cdot targetLength)$.

- Character Frequency Matrix (`charFrequency`): The `charFrequency` matrix stores the frequency of each character at each column of the `words` matrix. This matrix has dimensions of `wordLength x 26`, where 26 corresponds to the number of possible characters (assuming lowercase English letters). The space complexity of this matrix is $O(wordLength \cdot 26)$, which simplifies to $O(wordLength)$.

    Combining both, the overall space complexity is $O(wordLength \cdot targetLength)$.

### Approach 3: Optimized Bottom-up Dynamic Programming

#### Intuition

From the previous approach, we see that calculating the number of ways to form the target string at position `(currWord, currTarget)` depends only on two values: `(currWord-1, currTarget)` and `(currWord-1, currTarget-1)`. This relationship is expressed as:

$\text{currCount}[currTarget] = \text{currCount}[currTarget] + (charFrequency[currWord-1][target[currTarget-1] - 'a'] \cdot prevCount[currTarget-1]) \mod MOD$

Here:
- $\text{currCount}[currTarget]$ accumulates the count of ways to form the target string up to `currTarget`.
- $charFrequency[currWord-1][target[currTarget-1] - 'a']$ gives the frequency of the current target character in the previous word.
- `prevCount[currTarget-1]` provides the count of ways to form the target string up to the previous position before the current update.

This relationship ensures that each character from the `target` is considered while accounting for its frequency in the available words.

Using this insight, we can optimize the 2D DP table to a 1D array `currCount`, where each element represents the ways to form the target string up to a specific index. To manage the dependency on values from the previous row, we maintain an additional variable, `prevCount`, which temporarily stores the value of `currCount` before it is updated in the current iteration. Once all iterations are complete, the result is stored in `currCount[target.length()]`.

#### Algorithm

1. Create a 2D array `charFrequency` of size `wordLength x 26` to store the frequency of each character at every index in `words`. Iterate over each string in `words`, and for each string, increment the count of the respective character for the corresponding column in `charFrequency`.
2. Initialize two DP arrays: `prevCount` and `currCount`. Both arrays are of size $targetLength + 1$, and are initially set to `0`. Set $\text{prevCount}[0] = 1$ because there is one way to form an empty target string.
3. Iterate `currWord` from `1` to `wordLength`:
- Copy the values from `prevCount` to `currCount` to carry over the previous row.
- Iterate `currTarget` from `1` to `targetLength`:
- First, carry over the previous value without using the current column of words by setting $\text{currCount}[currTarget] = \text{prevCount}[currTarget]$.
- Then, if the character at $target[currTarget - 1]$ matches a character in words at $currWord - 1$, add the contribution from $charFrequency[currWord - 1][target[currTarget - 1] - 'a'] * prevCount[currTarget - 1]$ to $\text{currCount}[currTarget]$.
- Apply modulo $10^{9} + 7$ to the `result` to prevent overflow.
- After processing each `currWord`, copy the values of `currCount` to `prevCount` for the next iteration.
4. Finally, return the value in $\text{currCount}[targetLength]$, which stores the number of ways to form the target string using the entire words matrix.

#### Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def numWays(self, words: List[str], target: str) -> int:
        MOD = 1000000007
        word_length = len(words[0])
        target_length = len(target)
        char_frequency = [[0] * 26 for _ in range(word_length)]

        # Step 1: Calculate frequency of each character at every index in "words".
        for word in words:
            for j in range(word_length):
                char_frequency[j][ord(word[j]) - ord("a")] += 1

        # Step 2: Initialize two DP arrays: prev_count and curr_count.
        prev_count = [0] * (target_length + 1)
        curr_count = [0] * (target_length + 1)

        # Base case: There is one way to form an empty target string.
        prev_count[0] = 1

        # Step 3: Fill the DP arrays.
        for curr_word in range(1, word_length + 1):
            curr_count = prev_count.copy()
            for curr_target in range(1, target_length + 1):
                cur_pos = ord(target[curr_target - 1]) - ord("a")

                # If characters match, add the number of ways.
                curr_count[curr_target] += (
                    char_frequency[curr_word - 1][cur_pos]
* prev_count[curr_target - 1]
                ) % MOD
                curr_count[curr_target] %= MOD

            # Move current row to previous row for the next iteration.
            prev_count = curr_count.copy()

        # Step 4: The result is in prev[target_length].
        return curr_count[target_length]
```

#### Complexity Analysis

Let $\text{totalWords}$ be the total number of words in the `words` matrix, and $\text{wordLength}$ and $\text{targetLength}$ represent the length of any word in `words` and the `target` string, respectively.

- Time Complexity: $O(wordLength \cdot targetLength + wordLength \cdot totalWords)$

    To find the frequency of all the characters in the `words` matrix, we iterate through all the characters in the matrix. This takes $O(wordLength \cdot totalWords)$ time.

    The dynamic programming arrays `prevCount` and `currCount` are filled by iterating over each combination of `word` index and `target` index, leading to a total of $O(wordLength \cdot targetLength)$ iterations. Each iteration performs constant-time operations such as looking up values in the `charFrequency` matrix and updating the dp table.

    Therefore, the total time complexity is given by $O(wordLength \cdot targetLength + wordLength \cdot totalWords)$.

- Space Complexity: $O(wordLength)$

    The space complexity is dominated by two factors:

1. The dp arrays `prevCount` and `currCount`: These arrays store the results for every combination of `wordIndex` and `targetIndex`. Each array has a size of $(targetLength + 1)$, but since `targetLength` can't be larger than `wordLength`, the space complexity is effectively $O(wordLength)$.

2. Character Frequency Matrix (`charFrequency`): The `charFrequency` matrix stores the frequency of each character at each column of the `words` matrix. This matrix has dimensions of `wordLength x 26`, where 26 corresponds to the number of possible characters (assuming lowercase English letters). The space complexity of this matrix is $O(wordLength \cdot 26)$, which simplifies to $O(wordLength)$.

    Combining both, the overall space complexity is $O(wordLength)$.
