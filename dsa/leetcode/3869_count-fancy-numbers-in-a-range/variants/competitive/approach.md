## General
Given two integers `l` and `r`, the algorithm executes a two-pointer approach to shrink boundaries or maintain a sliding window. It utilizes a hash map (`dict`) to store element values and their indices/frequencies for $O(1)$ fast access, a dynamic programming memoization table to cache intermediate subproblem states. Key operations include bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`) for fast bitmask state updates. Edge case handling: guards against empty/null inputs via early returns, applies modulo arithmetic to prevent integer overflow.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(D^2)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(D^2)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
