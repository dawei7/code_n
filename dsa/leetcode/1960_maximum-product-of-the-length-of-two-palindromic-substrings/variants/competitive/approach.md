## General
### Beginner-Friendly Intuition & Strategy
The core task in **Maximum Product of the Length of Two Palindromic Substrings** is to a **0-indexed** string `s` and are tasked with finding two **non-intersecting palindromic **substrings of **odd** length such that the product of their lengths is maximized. Instead of recalculating the exact same subproblems over and over again, this solution uses **Dynamic Programming**. We break the larger problem down into smaller overlapping subproblems, solve each subproblem once, and store its result in a memory table. When building the final answer, we simply look up previously calculated answers.

### Step-by-Step Execution Guide
**Step 1: Setup & Initial State**  
We initialize a double-ended queue (`collections.deque`) to keep track of active window bounds or nodes waiting to be processed in order.  
**Step 2: Core Processing & Decisions**  
1. Inspect the elements at `array[left]` and `array[right]`.  
2. Compute the current metric (e.g. sum or container area).  
3. Compare against our target requirement.  
4. Advance `left += 1` or retreat `right -= 1` depending on whether we need a larger or smaller value.  
**Step 3: Completion & Result Return**  
Bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`) allow ultra-fast bitmask updates for set operations in $O(1)$ hardware instructions.  
When processing finishes, the algorithm outputs the final validated solution.

### Why This Handles Edge Cases Gracefully
- **Single Element / Border Cases:** Loop bounds handle single items and empty inputs naturally without array index out-of-bounds exceptions.


## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(N)$ — Detailed Analysis: The time complexity corresponds directly to the total number of operations required by the step-by-step execution loop described above.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(N)$ — Detailed Analysis: The space complexity reflects the auxiliary memory allocated for tracking structures, recursion stack depth, or hash maps during processing.
