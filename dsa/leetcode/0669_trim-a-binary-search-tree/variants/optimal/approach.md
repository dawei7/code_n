## General
Given the `root` of a binary search tree and the lowest and highest boundaries as `low` and `high`, trim the tree so that all its elements lies in `[low, high]`. Trimming the tree should **not** change the relative structur..., the algorithm executes a two-pointer approach to shrink boundaries or maintain a sliding window. It utilizes binary tree node references (`val`, `left`, `right`) to traverse structural hierarchies. Edge case handling: guards against empty/null inputs via early returns.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(N)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(H)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
