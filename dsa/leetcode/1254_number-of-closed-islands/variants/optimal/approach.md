## General
Given a 2D `grid` consists of `0s` (land) and `1s` (water).  An *island* is a maximal 4-directionally connected group of `0s` and a *closed island* is an island **totally** (all left, top, right, bottom) surrounded by `1s.`, the algorithm executes depth-first search (DFS) recursion to explore valid decision branches. Key operations include bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`) for fast bitmask state updates.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(N)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(N)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
