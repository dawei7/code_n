## General
Given an array of strings `words` and a string `target`, the algorithm executes a two-pointer approach to shrink boundaries or maintain a sliding window. It utilizes a hash map (`dict`) to store element values and their indices/frequencies for $O(1)$ fast access, a hash set (`set`) to track unique elements and prevent duplicate processing in $O(1)$ time, a double-ended queue (`deque`) to support dynamic $O(1)$ push and pop operations at both ends, a dynamic programming memoization table to cache intermediate subproblem states. Edge case handling: guards against empty/null inputs via early returns, applies modulo arithmetic to prevent integer overflow.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(S + T^2)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(S + T)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
