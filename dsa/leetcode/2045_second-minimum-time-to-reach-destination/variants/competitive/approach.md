## General
Given A city is represented as a **bi-directional connected** graph with `n` vertices where each vertex is labeled from `1` to `n` (**inclusive**). The edges in the graph are represented as a 2D integer array `edges`, where..., the algorithm executes a two-pointer approach to shrink boundaries or maintain a sliding window. It utilizes a hash set (`set`) to track unique elements and prevent duplicate processing in $O(1)$ time. Key operations include bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`) for fast bitmask state updates. Edge case handling: guards against empty/null inputs via early returns, applies modulo arithmetic to prevent integer overflow.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(N+E)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(N+E)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
