## General
Given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid` where each cell is either `0` (empty) or `1` (occupied), the algorithm executes a single-pass linear scan through input elements. Key operations include bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`) for fast bitmask state updates. Edge case handling: guards against empty/null inputs via early returns.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(mn)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(mn)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
