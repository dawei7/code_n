## General
Given an integer `side`, representing the edge length of a square with corners at `(0, 0)`, `(0, side)`, `(side, 0)`, and `(side, side)` on a Cartesian plane, the algorithm executes a two-pointer approach to shrink boundaries or maintain a sliding window. It utilizes a hash map (`dict`) to store element values and their indices/frequencies for $O(1)$ fast access. Key operations include bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`) for fast bitmask state updates.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n log n + n log k log side)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(n log k)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
