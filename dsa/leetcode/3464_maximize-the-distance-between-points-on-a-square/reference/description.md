## Description

You are given an integer `<font face="monospace">side</font>`, representing the edge length of a square with corners at `(0, 0)`, `(0, side)`, `(side, 0)`, and `(side, side)` on a Cartesian plane.

You are also given a **positive** integer `k` and a 2D integer array `points`, where `points[i] = [x_i, y_i]` represents the coordinate of a point lying on the **boundary** of the square.

You need to select `k` elements among `points` such that the **minimum** Manhattan distance between any two points is **maximized**.

Return the **maximum** possible **minimum** Manhattan distance between the selected `k` points.

The Manhattan Distance between two cells `(x_i, y_i)` and `(x_j, y_j)` is `|x_i - x_j| + |y_i - y_j|`.
