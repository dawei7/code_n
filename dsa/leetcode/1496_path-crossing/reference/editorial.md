### Approach: Hash Set

**Intuition**

We can split the problem into two parts. First, how can we simulate the movement described by `path`. Second, how do we determine if there is a crossing?

Initially, we are at the coordinates `(0, 0)`. At each step, we walk in one of four directions:

- North: no change in `x` coordinate, `+1` to `y` coordinate.
- South: no change in `x` coordinate, `-1` to `y` coordinate.
- West: `-1` to `x` coordinate, no change in `y` coordinate.
- East: `+1` to `x` coordinate, no change in `y` coordinate.

We can map each direction instruction in `path` to a change in `(x, y)` coordinates with a hash map `moves`:

- `'N' : (0, 1)`
- `'S' : (0, -1)`
- `'W' : (-1, 0)`
- `'E' : (1, 0)`

Let's keep track of our current coordinates using two variables `x` and `y`. We can initialize both `x` and `y` to `0` and then iterate over `path`. At each character of `path`, we get the values `dx` and `dy` from `moves`, then apply the change in coordinates by performing `x += dx` and `y += dy`.

How do we determine if the path crosses itself at any point? Because each movement only changes our position by exactly `1` unit, there will be a crossing if and only if we visit the same coordinates twice. Thus, we can use a hash set `visited` that keeps track of coordinates we have already visited.

We will initialize `visited` with `(0, 0)` and for each movement in `path`, we will first apply the changes `(dx, dy)`, then check if the updated `(x, y)` is in `visited`. If it is, then we have visited this coordinate point before and there is a crossing at this point, so we return `true`. If not, we add `(x, y)` to `visited` and move on to the next character in `path`.

If we complete all instructions in `path` without finding a crossing, we can return `false` as there are no crossings.

**Algorithm**

1. Create a hash map `moves` that maps the characters `N, S, W, E` to the corresponding values from above.
2. Initialize a hash set `visited` with `(0, 0)`.
3. Initialize $x = 0$ and $y = 0$.
4. For each `c` in `path`:
- Get `(dx, dy)` from $\text{moves}[c]$.
- Add `dx` to `x` and `dy` to `y`.
- Check if `(x, y)` is in `visited`. If it is, return `true`.
- Add `(x, y)` to `visited`.
5. Return `false`.

**Implementation**

> Note, in Java we use the `Pair` class and in C++ we convert our coordinates to strings for the purpose of hashing. In Python we can simply use tuples.
>
> We can't use `std::pair` in C++ because it doesn't natively support hashing. However, we can hash `string`, so we can express a pair of coordinates `(x, y)` as a string by separating the coordinates with a separator like a comma.

```python
class Solution:
    def isPathCrossing(self, path: str) -> bool:
        moves = {
            "N": (0, 1),
            "S": (0, -1),
            "W": (-1, 0),
            "E": (1, 0)
        }

        visited = {(0, 0)}
        x = 0
        y = 0

        for c in path:
            dx, dy = moves[c]
            x += dx
            y += dy

            if (x, y) in visited:
                return True

            visited.add((x, y))

        return False
```

**Complexity Analysis**

Given $n$ as the length of `path`,

* Time complexity: $O(n)$

    We iterate over each character of `path` once, performing $O(1)$ work at each iteration.

* Space complexity: $O(n)$

    When there are no crossings, `visited` will grow to a length of $n$.
