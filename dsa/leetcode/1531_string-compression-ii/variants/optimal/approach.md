## General
Given <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding">Run-length encoding</a> is a string compression method that works by replacing consecutive identical characters (repeated 2 or more times) with the concatenat..., the algorithm executes a single-pass linear scan through input elements. It utilizes a hash map (`dict`) to store element values and their indices/frequencies for $O(1)$ fast access, a dynamic programming memoization table to cache intermediate subproblem states.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n^2k)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(nk)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
