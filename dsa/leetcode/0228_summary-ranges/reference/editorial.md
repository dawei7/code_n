## Solution

### Overview

We are given a sorted unique integer array `nums`.

Our task is to return the smallest sorted list of ranges that cover all the numbers in the array exactly. That is, each element of `nums` is covered by exactly one of the ranges, and there is no integer `x` such that `x` is in one of the ranges but not in `nums`.

### Approach: Fix Left Bound

#### Intuition

We know that a range `[a, b]` is made up of successive numbers from `a` to `b` (both inclusive). Because the `nums` array is sorted, two consecutive elements in `nums` with a difference greater than `1` cannot belong to the same range. Also, if the difference between two consecutive elements in `nums` is `1`, they should be put in the same range.

To solve this problem we create a pointer $i = 0$ to iterate over all the elements of `nums`. We store the beginning of the current range in $start = \text{nums}[i]$, which will be used to put this range into the list that will be returned as the answer.

We check the next element in `nums` at index $i + 1$. If the next element differs by `1`, we include the $(i + 1)^{th}$ element in this range and increment `i` by `1` to check the next element. We keep adding elements in this range by incrementing `i` until we find an element that differs by more than `1`.

If the next element differs by more than `1` or we've covered all the elements in `nums`, we check whether `start` is equal to $\text{nums}[i]$ or not. If $start = \text{nums}[i]$, it signifies that this range has only one element. As instructed by the problem description, in that case, we only add `start` as a string to `ranges`. Otherwise, if $start \neq \text{nums}[i]$, we have more than one element in this range. As a result, we add the string $start->\text{nums}[i]$ to `ranges`.

After finishing a range, we increment `i` by `1` to start a new range and repeat the same process until we cover all the elements.

Here is a visual representation of how the approach works:

#### Algorithm

1. Create a list of strings `ranges` that contain the solution to the problem.

2. Iterate over all the elements in `nums` with the pointer $i = 0$:

- Each iteration of the outermost loop represents finding one range. To start, save the current range's beginning in $start = \text{nums}[i]$.

- Check whether the next element in `nums` at index $i + 1$ differs from $\text{nums}[i]$ by `1` or more. If the next element differs by `1`, we increase `i` by `1` to include the $(i + 1)^{th}$ element in this range and move ahead to check the next element. We keep adding elements in this range until the successive elements differ by `1`. We can use a while loop to accomplish this logic.

- Otherwise, if the next element differs by more than `1` or we have covered all the elements in `nums`, we check whether `start` is equal to $\text{nums}[i]$ or not. If $start = \text{nums}[i]$, we only add `start` as a string to `ranges` as we just have a single element in this range. Otherwise, if $start \neq \text{nums}[i]$, we add the string $start->\text{nums}[i]$ to `ranges`.

- We increment `i` by `1` to start a new range.

#### Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def summaryRanges(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[str]:
        ranges = []
        i = 0

        while i < len(nums):
            start = nums[i]
            while i + 1 < len(nums) and nums[i] + 1 == nums[i + 1]:
                i += 1

            if start != nums[i]:
                ranges.append(str(start) + "->" + str(nums[i]))
            else:
                ranges.append(str(nums[i]))

            i += 1

        return ranges
```

#### Complexity Analysis

Here $n$ is the number of elements in `nums`.

* Time complexity: $O(n)$.

- We iterate over each `nums` element once, either including it in the current range or creating a new range from it, which takes $O(n)$ time for $n$ elements.

- We also add all of the ranges to the `ranges` list. In the worst-case situation, $n$ elements could be added to the list if each consecutive element in `nums` differs by more than `1`, requiring $O(n)$ time to insert all the required ranges.

* Space complexity: $O(1)$.

- Except for a few integer variables like `i` and `start` that use constant space, we do not consume any space (if we ignore the space consumed by the input and output).
