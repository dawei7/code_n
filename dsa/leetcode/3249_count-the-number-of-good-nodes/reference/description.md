## Description

There is an **undirected** tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, and rooted at node `0`. You are given a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where `edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `a_i` and `b_i` in the tree.

A node is **good** if all the <span data-keyword="subtree">subtrees</span> rooted at its children have the same size.

Return the number of **good** nodes in the given tree.

A **subtree** of `treeName` is a tree consisting of a node in `treeName` and all of its descendants.
