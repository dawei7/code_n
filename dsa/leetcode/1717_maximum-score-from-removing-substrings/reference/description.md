### 1. Description

You are given a string `s` and two integers `x` and `y`. You can perform two types of operations any number of times.

- Remove substring `"ab"` and gain `x` points.

		<li>For example, when removing `"ab"` from `"c<u>ab</u>xbae"` it becomes `"cxbae"`.

	</li>
- Remove substring `"ba"` and gain `y` points.

		<li>For example, when removing `"ba"` from `"cabx<u>ba</u>e"` it becomes `"cabxe"`.

	</li>

Return *the maximum points you can gain after applying the above operations on* `s`.

### 2. Function Contract

- `n`: Input parameter.
- Returns expected result.

### 3. Examples

#### Example 1

- **Input:** `s = "cdbcbbaaabab", x = 4, y = 5`
- **Output:** `19`
- **Explanation:**
- Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcbbaaa<u>ba</u>b". Now, s = "cdbcbbaaab" and 5 points are added to the score.
- Remove the "ab" underlined in "cdbcbbaa<u>ab</u>". Now, s = "cdbcbbaa" and 4 points are added to the score.
- Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcb<u>ba</u>a". Now, s = "cdbcba" and 5 points are added to the score.
- Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbc<u>ba</u>". Now, s = "cdbc" and 5 points are added to the score.
Total score = 5 + 4 + 5 + 5 = 19.
#### Example 2

- **Input:** `s = "aabbaaxybbaabb", x = 5, y = 4`
- **Output:** `20`

### 4. Constraints

- $1 \le \text{s.length} \le 10^{5}$

- $1 \le x, y \le 10^{4}$

- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
