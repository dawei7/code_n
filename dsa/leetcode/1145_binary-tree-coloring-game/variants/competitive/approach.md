## General
Given Two players play a turn based game on a binary tree. We are given the `root` of this binary tree, and the number of nodes `n` in the tree. `n` is odd, and each node has a distinct value from `1` to `n`, the algorithm executes a two-pointer approach to shrink boundaries or maintain a sliding window. It utilizes binary tree node references (`val`, `left`, `right`) to traverse structural hierarchies. Edge case handling: guards against empty/null inputs via early returns.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(h)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
