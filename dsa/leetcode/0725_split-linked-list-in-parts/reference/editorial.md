### Overview

We are given a linked list `head` and an integer `k`. We want to split `head` evenly into `k` equally sized parts and return an array of the `k` parts. If `head` cannot be split evenly, the sizes of the `k` parts can differ by at most 1, with the larger parts appearing before the smaller ones.

### Approach 1: Create New Parts

### Intuition

We can split the linked list into `k` parts by considering two scenarios: when the list can be split evenly and when it cannot.

- **Even Split**: If the list's size `size` is divisible by `k`, each part will have exactly $size / k$ nodes.
- **Uneven Split**: If `size` is not divisible by `k`, a remainder of `size % k` nodes will remain after dividing $size / k$ nodes among the parts. To handle this, we add one extra node to the first `size % k` parts, making their size $size / k + 1$. The rest of the parts will have $size / k$ nodes.

In short, each part will have at least $size / k$ nodes. If the list doesn't split evenly, the first `size % k` parts will have one extra node.

To create these parts, we determine each part's size `currentSize`, then use a pointer to traverse the list. We visit the next `currentSize` nodes for each part and build a new linked list. Once the nodes for that part are processed, we assign the new list to the corresponding element in our array. We repeat this process for all `k` parts.

### Algorithm

1. Initialize `ans` array to store the `k` parts.
2. Initialize $size = 0$ and pointer $current = head$.
3. Iterate through `head` via `current` and increment `size` at each step to find the total size of `head`.
4. Now that `size` has the total size of the linked list, we can calculate the minimum size for the `k` parts: $splitSize = size / k$.
5. We can also calculate how many remaining nodes we have: $numRemainingParts = size \% k$.
6. Reset `current` back to `head` so we can iterate through the linked list again to create our `k` parts.
7. For `i` where `0 < i < k`:
* Initialize the head of the new part `newPart` to a dummy node and initialize a new pointer `tail` to keep track of the end of `newPart` for efficient appending
* Calculate the current size `currentSize` of the current part:
* Initialize $currentSize = splitSize$
* If there are any remaining parts (`numRemainingParts > 0`), then increment `currentSize` and decrement `numRemainingParts` to assign the remaining nodes to the first `size % k` parts
* Initialize a counter $j = 0$.
* While `j < currentSize`:
* Copy the current node and append it to `newPart` by performing $\text{tail.next} = new ListNode(\text{current.val})$.
* Advance `tail` since a new node just got added to the end
* Advance `current` to move on to the next node
* Increment `j`
* Now that `newPart` is fully built, we can assign it in our array: $\text{ans}[i] = \text{newPart.next}$
8. Return `ans`

### Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def splitListToParts(
        self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int
    ) -> List[Optional[ListNode]]:
        ans = [None] * k

        size = 0
        current = head
        while current is not None:
            size += 1
            current = current.next

        split_size = size // k
        num_remaining_parts = size % k

        current = head
        for i in range(k):
            new_part = ListNode(0)
            tail = new_part

            current_size = split_size
            if num_remaining_parts > 0:
                num_remaining_parts -= 1
                current_size += 1
            for j in range(current_size):
                tail.next = ListNode(current.val)
                tail = tail.next
                current = current.next
            ans[i] = new_part.next

        return ans
```

### Complexity Analysis

Let $N$ be the size of the linked list `head.`

* Time Complexity: $O(N)$

    We traverse the entire linked list `head` twice, where each time takes $O(N)$ time. Thus, the total time complexity is $O(N)$.

* Space Complexity: $O(N)$

    There are $N$ new nodes created. This results in a space complexity of $O(N)$. We ignore the $O(K)$ space needed for `ans` since the array is required for the question.

### Approach 2: Modify Linked List

### Intuition

In the previous approach, we required extra space because we created new nodes for the `k` parts, resulting in a space complexity of $O(N)$. In our second approach, we can modify the input linked list `head` to form the `k` parts directly, eliminating the need for extra space and reducing the space complexity to $O(1)$.

As before, we iterate through the linked list, processing the next `currentSize` nodes for each part. However, this time, when we reach the last node of a part, we set its `next` field to `null`, effectively dividing the linked list in place without creating new nodes.

> Before presenting this approach to the interviewer, check if modifications are allowed. Some interviewers permit changes, while others do not.

### Algorithm

1. Repeat steps 1-6 from Approach 1 to calculate the total size of the linked list, as well as the minimum size of the `k` parts and the number of remainder nodes.
2. Initialize a pointer $prev = current$ to keep track of the node preceding `current`
3. For `i` where `0 < i < k`:
* Initialize `newPart` to `current`, which will be the head of part `i`.
* Calculate the current size `currentSize` of the current part using the same logic in Approach 1
* Initialize a counter $j = 0$.
* While `j < currentSize`:
* Update `prev` to `current`
* Advance `current` to next node
* Increment `j`
* Now, `prev` is pointing to the last node of part `i`, and `current` is pointing to the head of part `i+1`. To cut off the rest of the linked list for part `i`, we reassign `prev.next` to null.
* Set $\text{ans}[i] = newPart$.
4. Return `ans`

### Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def splitListToParts(
        self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int
    ) -> List[Optional[ListNode]]:
        ans = [None] * k

        # get total size of linked list
        size = 0
        current = head
        while current is not None:
            size += 1
            current = current.next

        # minimum size for the k parts
        split_size = size // k

        # Remaining nodes after splitting the k parts evenly.
        # These will be distributed to the first (size % k) nodes
        num_remaining_parts = size % k

        current = head
        prev = current
        for i in range(k):
            # create the i-th part
            new_part = current
            # calculate size of i-th part
            current_size = split_size
            if num_remaining_parts > 0:
                num_remaining_parts -= 1
                current_size += 1

            # traverse to end of new part
            j = 0
            while j < current_size:
                prev = current
                if current is not None:
                    current = current.next
                j += 1

            # cut off the rest of linked list
            if prev is not None:
                prev.next = None

            ans[i] = new_part

        return ans
```

### Complexity Analysis

Let $N$ be the size of the linked list `head.`

* Time Complexity: $O(N)$

    `head` is traversed twice, which takes $O(N)$ time.

* Space Complexity: $O(1)$

    In contrast to Approach 1, no new nodes are created and the input is modified to create `k` parts. Thus, the space complexity is a constant $O(1)$.
