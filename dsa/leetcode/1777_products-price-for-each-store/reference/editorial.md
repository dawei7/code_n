<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
In this problem, we are tasked with finding the price of each product for each store in the initial dataframe `products`.

| product_id  | store  | price |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| 0           | store1 | 95    |
| 0           | store3 | 105   |
| 0           | store2 | 100   |
| 1           | store1 | 70    |
| 1           | store3 | 80    |

<br>

We can utilize pandas's `.pivot()` method to reorganize/reshape the data by converting columns into rows and vice-versa. To do this, we need to pass the columns into their respective parameters:
- Values passed into the `index` parameter become the DataFrame's new index
- Values passed into the `columns` parameter become the DataFrame's unique columns
- Values passed into the `values` parameter become the DataFrame's populated cells

In this case, we want to pass $\text{product}_{id}$ into the `index` and `store` into `columns` to create the structure of our pivot table below.

| product_id  | store1 | store2 | store3 |
|-------------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0           |        |        |        |
| 1           |        |        |        |

Lastly, to populate our pivot table with the prices of each product of each store, we will pass `price` into `values`, resulting in the the DataFrame below.

| product_id  | store1 | store2 | store3 |
|-------------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0           | 95     | 100    | 105    |
| 1           | 70     | null   | 80     |

#### Implementation

```python
import pandas as pd

def products_price(products: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    # Approach: Utilize .pivot() to get unique stores

    # Utilizing product_id as the index, we will destructure the values
    # as columns and have the values be the price
    df = products.pivot(index='product_id', columns='store', values='price').reset_index()

    return df
```

### Approach 1: Using `MAX, CASE WHEN` to pivot

<!-- h4 for sections -->
#### Intuition

<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
We will pivot our table by utilizing `CASE WHEN` and `AS` to produce new rows in our resulting table. While pivoting using `CASE WHEN`, it will not automatically group rows of the same $\text{product}_{id}$ to fill the next available value, thus resulting in a null `price` and a singular $\text{product}_{id}$.

To resolve this, we can use aggregation functions `MAX`, `MIN`, or `SUM` on the column `price` to grab the next available `price` for each $\text{product}_{id}$ rather than returning null and using `GROUP BY` to separate by unique $\text{product}_{id}$s. The role of the `MAX` function here is to ensure that only one row of results is returned for each product and to select the correct price for each store.

#### Implementation

```mysql []
SELECT
  product_id,
  MAX(CASE WHEN store = 'store1' THEN price END) AS store1,
  MAX(CASE WHEN store = 'store2' THEN price END) AS store2,
  MAX(CASE WHEN store = 'store3' THEN price END) AS store3
FROM
    Products
GROUP BY
    product_id
```
