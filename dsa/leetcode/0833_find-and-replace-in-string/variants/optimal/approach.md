## General
Given a **0-indexed** string `s` that you must perform `k` replacement operations on. The replacement operations are given as three **0-indexed** parallel arrays, `indices`, `sources`, and `targets`, all of length `k`, the algorithm executes a single-pass linear scan through input elements. It utilizes a hash map (`dict`) to store element values and their indices/frequencies for $O(1)$ fast access. Key operations include bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`) for fast bitmask state updates.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(C)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(C)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
