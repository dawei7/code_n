### Approach 1: Merge Intervals

**Intuition**

In an interval `[a, b]`, call `b` the "endpoint".

Among the given intervals, consider the interval $A[0]$ with the smallest endpoint.  (Without loss of generality, this interval occurs in array `A`.)

Then, among the intervals in array `B`, $A[0]$ can only intersect one such interval in array `B`.  (If two intervals in `B` intersect $A[0]$, then they both share the endpoint of $A[0]$ -- but intervals in `B` are disjoint, which is a contradiction.)

**Algorithm**

If $A[0]$ has the smallest endpoint, it can only intersect $B[0]$.  After, we can discard $A[0]$ since it cannot intersect anything else.

Similarly, if $B[0]$ has the smallest endpoint, it can only intersect $A[0]$, and we can discard $B[0]$ after since it cannot intersect anything else.

We use two pointers, `i` and `j`, to virtually manage "discarding" $A[0]$ or $B[0]$ repeatedly.

```python
class Solution:
    def intervalIntersection(self, A: List[List[int]], B: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        ans = []
        i = j = 0

        while i < len(A) and j < len(B):
            # Let's check if A[i] intersects B[j].
            # lo - the startpoint of the intersection
            # hi - the endpoint of the intersection
            lo = max(A[i][0], B[j][0])
            hi = min(A[i][1], B[j][1])
            if lo <= hi:
                ans.append([lo, hi])

            # Remove the interval with the smallest endpoint
            if A[i][1] < B[j][1]:
                i += 1
            else:
                j += 1

        return ans
```

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $O(M + N)$, where $M, N$ are the lengths of `A` and `B` respectively.

* Space Complexity:  $O(M + N)$, the maximum size of the answer.
