## Description

There exists an **undirected** tree with `n` nodes numbered `0` to `n - 1`. You are given a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `u_i` and `v_i` in the tree.

Initially, **all** nodes are **unmarked**. After every second, you mark all unmarked nodes which have **at least** one marked node *adjacent* to them.

Return an array `nodes` where `nodes[i]` is the last node to get marked in the tree, if you mark node `i` at time `t = 0`. If `nodes[i]` has *multiple* answers for any node `i`, you can choose** any** one answer.

**Example 1:**

<div class="example-block">
**Input:** <span class="example-io">edges = [[0,1],[0,2]]</span>

**Output:** [2,2,1]

**Explanation:**

	- For `i = 0`, the nodes are marked in the sequence: `[0] -> [0,1,2]`. Either 1 or 2 can be the answer.

	- For `i = 1`, the nodes are marked in the sequence: `[1] -> [0,1] -> [0,1,2]`. Node 2 is marked last.

	- For `i = 2`, the nodes are marked in the sequence: `[2] -> [0,2] -> [0,1,2]`. Node 1 is marked last.

</div>

**Example 2:**

<div class="example-block">
**Input:** <span class="example-io">edges = [[0,1]]</span>

**Output:** [1,0]

**Explanation:**

	- For `i = 0`, the nodes are marked in the sequence: `[0] -> [0,1]`.

	- For `i = 1`, the nodes are marked in the sequence: `[1] -> [0,1]`.

</div>

**Example 3:**

<div class="example-block">
**Input:** <span class="example-io">edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[2,4]]</span>

**Output:** [3,3,1,1,1]

**Explanation:**

![](images/screenshot-2024-06-03-210550.png)

	- For `i = 0`, the nodes are marked in the sequence: `[0] -> [0,1,2] -> [0,1,2,3,4]`.

	- For `i = 1`, the nodes are marked in the sequence: `[1] -> [0,1] -> [0,1,2] -> [0,1,2,3,4]`.

	- For `i = 2`, the nodes are marked in the sequence: `[2] -> [0,2,3,4] -> [0,1,2,3,4]`.

	- For `i = 3`, the nodes are marked in the sequence: `[3] -> [2,3] -> [0,2,3,4] -> [0,1,2,3,4]`.

	- For `i = 4`, the nodes are marked in the sequence: `[4] -> [2,4] -> [0,2,3,4] -> [0,1,2,3,4]`.

</div>

**Constraints:**

	- `2 <= n <= 10^5`

	- `edges.length == n - 1`

	- `edges[i].length == 2`

	- `0 <= edges[i][0], edges[i][1] <= n - 1`

	- The input is generated such that `edges` represents a valid tree.
