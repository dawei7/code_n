## General
Given a `m x n` matrix `mat` and an integer `threshold`, return *the maximum side-length of a square with a sum less than or equal to *`threshold`* or return *`0`* if there is no such square*, the algorithm executes binary search over the search space to achieve logarithmic reduction. It utilizes a hash map (`dict`) to store element values and their indices/frequencies for $O(1)$ fast access, a dynamic programming memoization table to cache intermediate subproblem states. Edge case handling: guards against empty/null inputs via early returns.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(mn)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(mn)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
