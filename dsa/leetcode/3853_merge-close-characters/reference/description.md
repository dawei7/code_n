## Description

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters and an integer `k`.

Two **equal** characters in the **current** string `s` are considered **close** if the distance between their indices is **at most** `k`.

When two characters are **close**, the right one merges into the left. Merges happen **one at a time**, and after each merge, the string updates until no more merges are possible.

Return the resulting string after performing all possible merges.

**Note**: If multiple merges are possible, always merge the pair with the **smallest left** index. If multiple pairs share the smallest left index, choose the pair with the **smallest right** index.
