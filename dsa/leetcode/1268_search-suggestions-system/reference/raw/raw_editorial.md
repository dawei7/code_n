### Approach 1: Binary Search

**Intuition**

Since the question asks for the result in a sorted order, let's start with sorting `products`.
An advantage that comes with sorting is `Binary Search`, we can binary search for the prefix. Once we locate the first match of prefix, all we need to do is to add the next 3 words into the result (if there are any), since we sorted the words beforehand.

**Algorithm**

1. Sort the input `products`.
2. Iterate each character of the `searchWord` adding it to the `prefix` to search for.
3. After adding the current character to the `prefix` binary search for the `prefix` in the input.
4. Add next 3 strings from the current binary search `start` index till the prefix remains same.
5. Another optimization that can be done is reducing the binary search space to current `start` index (This is due to the fact that adding more characters to the prefix will make the next search result's index be at least > current search's index).


```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<string>> suggestedProducts(vector<string> &products,
                                             string searchWord) {
        sort(products.begin(), products.end());
        vector<vector<string>> result;
        int start, bsStart = 0, n=products.size();
        string prefix;
        for (char &c : searchWord) {
            prefix += c;

            // Get the starting index of word starting with `prefix`.
            start = lower_bound(products.begin() + bsStart, products.end(), prefix) - products.begin();

            // Add empty vector to result.
            result.push_back({});

            // Add the words with the same prefix to the result.
            // Loop runs until `i` reaches the end of input or 3 times or till the
            // prefix is same for `products[i]` Whichever comes first.
            for (int i = start; i < min(start + 3, n) && !products[i].compare(0, prefix.length(), prefix); i++)
                result.back().push_back(products[i]);

            // Reduce the size of elements to binary search on since we know
            bsStart = start;
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```


**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $$O(nlog(n)) + O(mlog(n))$$. Where `n` is the length of `products` and `m` is the length of the search word. Here we treat string comparison in sorting as  $$O(1)$$.  $$O(nlog(n))$$ comes from the sorting and $$O(mlog(n))$$ comes from running `binary search` on products `m` times.

  * In Java there is an additional complexity of $$O(m^2)$$ due to Strings being immutable, here `m` is the length of `searchWord`.

* Space complexity : Varies between $$O(1)$$ and $$O(n)$$ where `n` is the length of `products`, as it depends on the implementation used for sorting. We ignore the space required for output as it does not affect the algorithm's space complexity. See [Internal details of std::sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/internal-details-of-stdsort-in-c/).
Space required for output is $$O(m)$$ where `m` is the length of the search word.

### Approach 2: Trie + DFS

**Intuition**

Whenever we come across questions with multiple strings, it is best to think if [Trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) can help us. What we need here is a way to search for all the words with given prefix, this is a well known problem that trie can solve. The question also asks for a sorted results, if you look closely a trie word is represented by it's preorder traversal. It is also worth noting that a preorder traversal of a trie will always result in a sorted traversal of results, thus all we need to do is limit the word traversal to 3.

Questions using Trie:

**Algorithm**

1. Create a Trie from the given products input.
2. Iterate each character of the `searchWord` adding it to the `prefix` to search for.
3. After adding the current character to the `prefix` traverse the `trie` pointer to the node representing `prefix`.
4. Now traverse the tree from `curr` pointer in a preorder fashion and record whenever we encounter a complete word.
5. Limit the result to 3 and return `dfs` once reached this limit.
6. Add the words to the final result.


```cpp
// Custom class Trie with function to get 3 words starting with given prefix
class Trie
{
    // Node definition of a trie
    struct Node {
        bool isWord = false;
        vector<Node *> children{vector<Node *>(26, NULL)};
    } * Root, *curr;

    // Runs a DFS on trie starting with given prefix and adds all the words in the result, limiting result size to 3
    void dfsWithPrefix(Node * curr, string & word, vector<string> & result) {
        if (result.size() == 3)
            return;
        if (curr->isWord)
            result.push_back(word);

        // Run DFS on all possible paths.
        for (char c = 'a'; c <= 'z'; c++)
            if (curr->children[c - 'a']) {
                word += c;
                dfsWithPrefix(curr->children[c - 'a'], word, result);
                word.pop_back();
            }
    }

public:
    Trie() {
        Root = new Node();
    }
    // Inserts the string in trie.
    void insert(string & s) {
        // Points curr to the root of trie.
        curr = Root;
        for (char &c : s) {
            if (!curr->children[c - 'a'])
                curr->children[c - 'a'] = new Node();
            curr = curr->children[c - 'a'];
        }
        // Mark this node as a completed word.
        curr->isWord = true;
    }
    vector<string> getWordsStartingWith(string & prefix) {
        curr = Root;
        vector<string> result;

        // Move curr to the end of prefix in its trie representation.
        for (char &c : prefix) {
            if (!curr->children[c - 'a'])
                return result;
            curr = curr->children[c - 'a'];
        }
        dfsWithPrefix(curr, prefix, result);
        return result;
    }
};
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<string>> suggestedProducts(vector<string> &products,
                                             string searchWord) {
        Trie trie=Trie();
        vector<vector<string>> result;

        // Add all words to trie.
        for(string &w:products)
            trie.insert(w);
        string prefix;
        for (char &c : searchWord) {
            prefix += c;
            result.push_back(trie.getWordsStartingWith(prefix));
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```


**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $$O(M)$$ to build the `trie` where `M` is total number of characters in `products` For each `prefix` we find its representative node in $$O(\text{len(prefix)})$$ and dfs to find at most 3 words which is an `O(1)` operation. Thus the overall complexity is dominated by the time required to build the `trie`.

  * In Java there is an additional complexity of $$O(m^2)$$ due to Strings being immutable, here `m` is the length of `searchWord`.

* Space complexity : $$O(26n)=O(n)$$. Here `n` is the number of nodes in the `trie`. `26` is the alphabet size.
Space required for output is $$O(m)$$ where `m` is the length of the search word.
