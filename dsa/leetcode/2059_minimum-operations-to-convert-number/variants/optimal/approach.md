## General
Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` containing **distinct** numbers, an integer `start`, and an integer `goal`. There is an integer `x` that is initially set to `start`, and you want to perform operations on `x` such..., the algorithm executes breadth-first search (BFS) level-order traversal using a queue. It utilizes a double-ended queue (`deque`) to support dynamic $O(1)$ push and pop operations at both ends. Key operations include bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`) for fast bitmask state updates.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(Rm)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(R)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
