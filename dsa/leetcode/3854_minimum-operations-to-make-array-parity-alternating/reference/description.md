## Description

You are given an integer array `nums`.

An array is called **parity alternating** if for every index `i` where `0 <= i < n - 1`, `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` have different parity (one is even and the other is odd).

In one operation, you may choose any index `i` and either increase `nums[i]` by 1 or decrease `nums[i]` by 1.

Return an integer array `answer` of length 2 where:

<ul>
	<li>`answer[0]` is the **minimum** number of operations required to make the array parity alternating.</li>
	<li>`answer[1]` is the **minimum** possible value of `max(nums) - min(nums)` taken over all arrays that are parity alternating and can be obtained by performing **exactly** `answer[0]` operations.</li>
</ul>

An array of length 1 is considered parity alternating.
