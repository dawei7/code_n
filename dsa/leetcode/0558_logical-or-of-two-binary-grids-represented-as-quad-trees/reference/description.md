## Description

A Binary Matrix is a matrix in which all the elements are either **0** or **1**.

Given `quadTree1` and `quadTree2`. `quadTree1` represents a `n * n` binary matrix and `quadTree2` represents another `n * n` binary matrix.

Return *a Quad-Tree* representing the `n * n` binary matrix which is the result of **logical bitwise OR** of the two binary matrixes represented by `quadTree1` and `quadTree2`.

Notice that you can assign the value of a node to **True** or **False** when `isLeaf` is **False**, and both are **accepted** in the answer.

A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:

<ul>
	<li>`val`: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's.</li>
	<li>`isLeaf`: True if the node is leaf node on the tree or False if the node has the four children.</li>
</ul>

```

class Node {
    public boolean val;
    public boolean isLeaf;
    public Node topLeft;
    public Node topRight;
    public Node bottomLeft;
    public Node bottomRight;
}
```

We can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:

<ol>
	<li>If the current grid has the same value (i.e all `1's` or all `0's`) set `isLeaf` True and set `val` to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.</li>
	<li>If the current grid has different values, set `isLeaf` to False and set `val` to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.</li>
	<li>Recurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.</li>
</ol>

**Quad-Tree format:**

The input/output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where `null` signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.

It is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list `[isLeaf, val]`.

If the value of `isLeaf` or `val` is True we represent it as **1** in the list `[isLeaf, val]` and if the value of `isLeaf` or `val` is False we represent it as **0**.
