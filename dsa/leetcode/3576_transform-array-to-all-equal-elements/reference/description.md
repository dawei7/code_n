## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` of size `n` containing only `1` and `-1`, and an integer `k`.

You can perform the following operation at most `k` times:

<ul>
	<li>
	Choose an index `i` (`0 <= i < n - 1`), and **multiply** both `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` by `-1`.

	</li>
</ul>

**Note** that you can choose the same index <code data-end="459" data-start="456">i</code> more than once in **different** operations.

Return `true` if it is possible to make all elements of the array **equal** after at most `k` operations, and `false` otherwise.
