## Description

You are given an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a graph, labeled from 0 to `n - 1`.

You are also given an integer array `nums` of length `n` sorted in **non-decreasing** order, and an integer `maxDiff`.

An **undirected **edge exists between nodes `i` and `j` if the **absolute** difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is **at most** `maxDiff` (i.e., `|nums[i] - nums[j]| <= maxDiff`).

You are also given a 2D integer array `queries`. For each `queries[i] = [u_i, v_i]`, determine whether there exists a path between nodes `u_i` and `v_i`.

Return a boolean array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is `true` if there exists a path between `u_i` and `v_i` in the `i^th` query and `false` otherwise.
