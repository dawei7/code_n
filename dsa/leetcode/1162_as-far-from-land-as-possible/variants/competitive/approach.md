## General
Given an `n x n` `grid` containing only values `0` and `1`, where `0` represents water and `1` represents land, find a water cell such that its distance to the nearest land cell is maximized, and return the distance. If no ..., the algorithm executes breadth-first search (BFS) level-order traversal using a queue. It utilizes a double-ended queue (`deque`) to support dynamic $O(1)$ push and pop operations at both ends. Edge case handling: guards against empty/null inputs via early returns.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n^2)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(n^2)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
