## General
Given an array of integers preorder, which represents the **preorder traversal** of a BST (i.e., **binary search tree**), construct the tree and return *its root*, the algorithm executes a two-pointer approach to shrink boundaries or maintain a sliding window. It utilizes a hash map (`dict`) to store element values and their indices/frequencies for $O(1)$ fast access, binary tree node references (`val`, `left`, `right`) to traverse structural hierarchies. Key operations include bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`) for fast bitmask state updates.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(N)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(H)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
