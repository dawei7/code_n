### Approach 1: Depth-first Search

Because the input is nested, it is natural to think about the problem in a recursive way. We go through the list of nested integers one by one, keeping track of the current depth $d$. If a nested integer is an integer, $n$, we calculate its sum as $n\times d$. If the nested integer is a list, we calculate the sum of this list recursively using the same process but with depth equals $d + 1$.

**Implementation**

```python
class Solution:
    def depthSum(self, nestedList: List[NestedInteger]) -> int:

        def dfs(nested_list, depth):
            total = 0
            for nested in nested_list:
                if nested.isInteger():
                    total += nested.getInteger() * depth
                else:
                    total += dfs(nested.getList(), depth + 1)
            return total

        return dfs(nestedList, 1)

```

**Complexity Analysis**

Let $N$ be the total number of nested elements in the input list. For example, the list `````[ [[[[1]]]], 2 ]````` contains $4$ nested lists and $2$ nested integers ($1$ and $2$), so $N = 6$ for that particular case.

* Time complexity : $\mathcal{O}(N)$.

    Recursive functions can be a bit tricky to analyze, particularly when their implementation includes a loop. A good strategy is to start by determining how many times the recursive function is called, and then how many times the loop will iterate *across all calls to the recursive function*.

    The recursive function, `dfs(...)` is called exactly **once** for each *nested list*. As $N$ also includes nested integers, we know that the number of recursive calls has to be *less than $N$*.

    On each nested list, it iterates over all of the nested elements **directly inside that list** (in other words, not nested further). As each nested element can only be directly inside **one** list, we know that there must only be one loop iteration *for each nested element*. This is a total of $N$ loop iterations.

    So combined, we are performing at most $2 \cdot N$ recursive calls and loop iterations. We drop the $2$ as it is a constant, leaving us with time complexity $\mathcal{O}(N)$.

* Space complexity : $\mathcal{O}(N)$.

    In terms of space, at most $O(D)$ recursive calls are placed on the stack, where $D$ is the maximum level of nesting in the input. For example, $D=2$ for the input `````[[1,1],2,[1,1]]`````, and $D=3$ for the input `````[1,[4,[6]]]`````.

    In the worst case, $D = N$, (e.g. the list `[[[[[[]]]]]]`) so the worst-case space complexity is $O(N)$.

### Approach 2: Breadth-first Search

We can also solve the problem using a breadth-first search. The algorithm for this is closely based on the [standard breadth-first search template](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/queue-stack/231/practical-application-queue/1372/). The algorithm fully processes each depth before moving to the next one.

**Implementation**

```python
class Solution:
    def depthSum(self, nestedList: List[NestedInteger]) -> int:
        queue = deque(nestedList)

        depth = 1
        total = 0

        while len(queue) > 0:
            for i in range(len(queue)):
                nested = queue.pop()
                if nested.isInteger():
                    total += nested.getInteger() * depth
                else:
                    queue.extendleft(nested.getList())
            depth += 1

        return total
```

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $\mathcal{O}(N)$.

    Similar to the DFS approach. Each nested element is put on the queue and removed from the queue exactly once.

* Space complexity : $\mathcal{O}(N)$.

    The worst-case for space complexity in BFS occurs where most of the elements are in a single layer, for example, a flat list such as `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` as all of the elements must be put on the queue at the same time. Therefore, this approach also has a worst-case space complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N)$.
