## General
### Beginner-Friendly Intuition & Strategy
The core task in **Maximum Profit from Valid Topological Order in DAG** is to a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to $n - 1$, represented by a 2D array `edges`, where $\text{edges}[i] = [u_{i}, v_{i}]$ indicates a directed edge from node $u_{i}$ to $v_{i}$. Each node has an associated **score** given in an array `score`, w.... Instead of recalculating the exact same subproblems over and over again, this solution uses **Dynamic Programming**. We break the larger problem down into smaller overlapping subproblems, solve each subproblem once, and store its result in a memory table. When building the final answer, we simply look up previously calculated answers.

### Step-by-Step Execution Guide
**Step 1: Setup & Base Cases**  
We create a Dynamic Programming table and initialize known base cases.  
**Step 2: Core Processing & Traversal**  
1. Iterate sequentially through each element.  
2. Apply operational rules to update state variables.  
**Step 3: Completion & Return**  
Bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`) allow ultra-fast bitmask updates in $O(1)$ hardware instructions.  
When processing finishes, the algorithm outputs the final validated solution.

### Why This Handles Edge Cases Gracefully
- **Empty / Null Inputs:** Early guard checks return empty results immediately without crashing.


## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n * 2^n)$ — Detailed Analysis: The time complexity corresponds directly to the total number of operations required by the step-by-step execution loop described above.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(2^n)$ — Detailed Analysis: The space complexity reflects the auxiliary memory allocated for tracking structures, recursion stack depth, or hash maps during processing.
