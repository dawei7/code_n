## General
Given several logs, where each log contains a unique ID and timestamp. Timestamp is a string that has the following format: `Year:Month:Day:Hour:Minute:Second`, for example, `2017:01:01:23:59:59`. All domains are zero-padde..., the algorithm executes a single-pass linear scan through input elements. It utilizes a hash map (`dict`) to store element values and their indices/frequencies for $O(1)$ fast access.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(QP)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(P)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
