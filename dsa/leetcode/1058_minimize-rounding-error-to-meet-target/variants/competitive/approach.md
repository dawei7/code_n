## General
### Beginner-Friendly Intuition & Strategy
The core task in **Minimize Rounding Error to Meet Target** is to an array of `prices` `[p_1,p_2...,p_n]` and a `target`, round each price $p_{i}$ to $\text{Round}_{i}(p_{i})$ so that the rounded array `[Round_1(p_1),Round_2(p_2)...,Round_n(p_n)]` sums to the given `target`. Each operation $\text{Round}_{i}(p_{i})$ could be either $Floor(p_{.... Instead of using nested loops that inspect every pair in $O(n^2)$ time, this algorithm uses the **Two-Pointer technique**. We place two markers (pointers)—typically one at the start (`left`) and one at the end (`right`) of a sorted array—and move them toward each other based on clear comparison rules, completing the search in a single efficient pass.

### Step-by-Step Execution Guide
**Step 1: Setup & Initial State**  
We place `left = 0` at the very beginning of the array and `right = len(array) - 1` at the very end.  
**Step 2: Core Processing & Decisions**  
1. Inspect the elements at `array[left]` and `array[right]`.  
2. Compute the current metric (e.g. sum or container area).  
3. Compare against our target requirement.  
4. Advance `left += 1` or retreat `right -= 1` depending on whether we need a larger or smaller value.  
**Step 3: Completion & Result Return**  
When processing finishes, the algorithm outputs the final validated solution.

### Why This Handles Edge Cases Gracefully
- **Empty / Null Inputs:** Early guard checks return empty results immediately without crashing.
- **Single Element / Border Cases:** Loop bounds handle single items and empty inputs naturally without array index out-of-bounds exceptions.


## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(N+K)$ — Detailed Analysis: The time complexity corresponds directly to the total number of operations required by the step-by-step execution loop described above.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(K)$ — Detailed Analysis: The space complexity reflects the auxiliary memory allocated for tracking structures, recursion stack depth, or hash maps during processing.
