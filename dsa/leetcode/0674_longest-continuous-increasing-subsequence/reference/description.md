## Description

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return *the length of the longest **continuous increasing subsequence** (i.e. subarray)*. The subsequence must be **strictly** increasing.

A **continuous increasing subsequence** is defined by two indices `l` and `r` (`l < r`) such that it is `[nums[l], nums[l + 1], ..., nums[r - 1], nums[r]]` and for each $l \le i < r$, $\text{nums}[i] < nums[i + 1]$.
### Function Contract

- `n`: Input parameter.
- Returns expected result.

### Examples
#### Example 1

- **Input:** `nums = [1,3,5,4,7]`
- **Output:** `3`
- **Explanation:** The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5] with length 3.
Even though [1,3,5,7] is an increasing subsequence, it is not continuous as elements 5 and 7 are separated by element
4.
#### Example 2

- **Input:** `nums = [2,2,2,2,2]`
- **Output:** `1`
- **Explanation:** The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2] with length 1. Note that it must be strictly
increasing.
### Constraints

- $1 \le \text{nums.length} \le 10^{4}$

- $-10^{9} \le \text{nums}[i] \le 10^{9}$
