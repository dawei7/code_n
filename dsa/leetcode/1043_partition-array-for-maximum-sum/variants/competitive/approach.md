## General
Given an integer array `arr`, partition the array into (contiguous) subarrays of length **at most** `k`. After partitioning, each subarray has their values changed to become the maximum value of that subarray, the algorithm executes a single-pass linear scan through input elements. It utilizes a dynamic programming memoization table to cache intermediate subproblem states. Edge case handling: applies modulo arithmetic to prevent integer overflow.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(NK)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(N)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
