### 1. Description

You are given an array of integers `nums`. You **must** repeatedly perform one of the following operations while the array has more than two elements:

- Remove the first two elements.

- Remove the last two elements.

- Remove the first and last element.

For each operation, add the sum of the removed elements to your total score.

Return the **maximum** possible score you can achieve.

### 2. Function Contract

- Refer to method signature.

### 3. Examples

#### Example 1

- **Input:** nums = [2,4,1]

- **Output:** 6

- **Explanation:** The possible operations are:

- Remove the first two elements $(2 + 4) = 6$. The remaining array is `[1]`.

- Remove the last two elements $(4 + 1) = 5$. The remaining array is `[2]`.

- Remove the first and last elements $(2 + 1) = 3$. The remaining array is `[4]`.

The maximum score is obtained by removing the first two elements, resulting in a final score of 6.

#### Example 2

- **Input:** nums = [5,-1,4,2]

- **Output:** 7

- **Explanation:** The possible operations are:

- Remove the first and last elements $(5 + 2) = 7$. The remaining array is `[-1, 4]`.

- Remove the first two elements $(5 + -1) = 4$. The remaining array is `[4, 2]`.

- Remove the last two elements $(4 + 2) = 6$. The remaining array is `[5, -1]`.

The maximum score is obtained by removing the first and last elements, resulting in a total score of 7.

### 4. Constraints

- $1 \le \text{nums.length} \le 10^{5}$

- $-10^{4} \le \text{nums}[i] \le 10^{4}$
