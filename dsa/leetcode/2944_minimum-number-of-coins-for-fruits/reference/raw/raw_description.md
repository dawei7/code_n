## Description

You are given an **0-indexed** integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` denotes the number of coins needed to purchase the `(i + 1)^th` fruit.

The fruit market has the following reward for each fruit:

	- If you purchase the `(i + 1)^th` fruit at `prices[i]` coins, you can get any number of the next `i` fruits for free.

**Note** that even if you **can** take fruit `j` for free, you can still purchase it for `prices[j - 1]` coins to receive its reward.

Return the **minimum** number of coins needed to acquire all the fruits.

**Example 1:**

<div class="example-block">
**Input:** <span class="example-io">prices = [3,1,2]</span>

**Output:** <span class="example-io">4</span>

**Explanation:**

	- Purchase the 1^st fruit with `prices[0] = 3` coins, you are allowed to take the 2^nd fruit for free.

	- Purchase the 2^nd fruit with `prices[1] = 1` coin, you are allowed to take the 3^rd fruit for free.

	- Take the 3^rd fruit for free.

Note that even though you could take the 2^nd fruit for free as a reward of buying 1^st fruit, you purchase it to receive its reward, which is more optimal.

</div>

**Example 2:**

<div class="example-block">
**Input:** <span class="example-io">prices = [1,10,1,1]</span>

**Output:** <span class="example-io">2</span>

**Explanation:**

	- Purchase the 1^st fruit with `prices[0] = 1` coin, you are allowed to take the 2^nd fruit for free.

	- Take the 2^nd fruit for free.

	- Purchase the 3^rd fruit for `prices[2] = 1` coin, you are allowed to take the 4^th fruit for free.

	- Take the 4^t^h fruit for free.

</div>

**Example 3:**

<div class="example-block">
**Input:** <span class="example-io">prices = [26,18,6,12,49,7,45,45]</span>

**Output:** <span class="example-io">39</span>

**Explanation:**

	- Purchase the 1^st fruit with `prices[0] = 26` coin, you are allowed to take the 2^nd fruit for free.

	- Take the 2^nd fruit for free.

	- Take the 4^t^h fruit for free.

	- Take the 5^t^h fruit for free.

	- Purchase the 6^th fruit with `prices[5] = 7` coin, you are allowed to take the 8^th and 9^th fruit for free.

	- Take the 7^t^h fruit for free.

	- Take the 8^t^h fruit for free.
