## General
Given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters, an integer `t` representing the number of **transformations** to perform, and an array `nums` of size 26. In one **transformation**, every character in `s` is repl..., the algorithm executes a single-pass linear scan through input elements. Key operations include bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`) for fast bitmask state updates. Edge case handling: applies modulo arithmetic to prevent integer overflow.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n + A^3 log t)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(A^2)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
