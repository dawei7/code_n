## Description

You are given an array of strings `words` and an integer `k`.

For each index `i` in the range `[0, words.length - 1]`, find the **length** of the **longest common <span data-keyword="string-prefix">prefix</span>** among any `k` strings (selected at **distinct indices**) from the remaining array after removing the `i^th` element.

Return an array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the answer for `i^th` element. If removing the `i^th` element leaves the array with fewer than `k` strings, `answer[i]` is 0.
