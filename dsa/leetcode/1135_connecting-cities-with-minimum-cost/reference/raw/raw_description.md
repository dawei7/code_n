## Description

There are `n` cities labeled from `1` to `n`. You are given the integer `n` and an array `connections` where `connections[i] = [x_i, y_i, cost_i]` indicates that the cost of connecting city `x_i` and city `y_i` (bidirectional connection) is `cost_i`.

Return *the minimum **cost** to connect all the *`n`* cities such that there is at least one path between each pair of cities*. If it is impossible to connect all the `n` cities, return `-1`,

The **cost** is the sum of the connections' costs used.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** n = 3, connections = [[1,2,5],[1,3,6],[2,3,1]]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** Choosing any 2 edges will connect all cities so we choose the minimum 2.
```

**Example 2:**

![](images/1314_ex1.png)

```
**Input:** n = 4, connections = [[1,2,3],[3,4,4]]
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** There is no way to connect all cities even if all edges are used.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n <= 10^4`

	- `1 <= connections.length <= 10^4`

	- `connections[i].length == 3`

	- `1 <= x_i, y_i <= n`

	- `x_i != y_i`

	- `0 <= cost_i <= 10^5`
