## Description

The **diameter** of a tree is **the number of edges** in the longest path in that tree.

There is an undirected tree of `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given a 2D array `edges` where `edges.length == n - 1` and `edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between nodes `a_i` and `b_i` in the tree.

Return *the **diameter** of the tree*.

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** edges = [[0,1],[0,2]]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The longest path of the tree is the path 1 - 0 - 2.
```

**Example 2:**

![](images/tree2.jpg)

```
**Input:** edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[1,4],[4,5]]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The longest path of the tree is the path 3 - 2 - 1 - 4 - 5.
```

**Constraints:**

	- `n == edges.length + 1`

	- `1 <= n <= 10^4`

	- `0 <= a_i, b_i < n`

	- `a_i != b_i`
