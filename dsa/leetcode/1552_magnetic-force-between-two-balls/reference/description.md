## Description

In the universe Earth C-137, Rick discovered a special form of magnetic force between two balls if they are put in his new invented basket. Rick has `n` empty baskets, the $$i^{\text{th}}$$ basket is at $\text{position}[i]$, Morty has `m` balls and needs to distribute the balls into the baskets such that the **minimum magnetic force** between any two balls is **maximum**.

Rick stated that magnetic force between two different balls at positions `x` and `y` is $|x - y|$.

Given the integer array `position` and the integer `m`. Return *the required force*.
### Function Contract

- `n`: Input parameter.
- Returns expected result.

### Examples

#### Example 1

![](images/q3v1.jpg)

- **Input:** $position = [1,2,3,4,7], m = 3$
- **Output:** `3`
- **Explanation:** Distributing the 3 balls into baskets 1, 4 and 7 will make the magnetic force between ball pairs [3, 3, 6]. The minimum magnetic force is 3. We cannot achieve a larger minimum magnetic force than 3.
#### Example 2

- **Input:** $position = [5,4,3,2,1,1000000000], m = 2$
- **Output:** `999999999`
- **Explanation:** We can use baskets 1 and 1000000000.
### Constraints

- $n = \text{position.length}$

- $2 \le n \le 10^{5}$

- $1 \le \text{position}[i] \le 10^{9}$

- All integers in `position` are **distinct**.

- $2 \le m \le \text{position.length}$
