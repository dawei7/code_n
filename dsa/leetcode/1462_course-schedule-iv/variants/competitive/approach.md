## General
Given There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to $numCourses - 1$. You are given an array `prerequisites` where $\text{prerequisites}[i] = [a_{i}, b_{i}]$ indicates that you **must** tak..., the algorithm executes a single-pass linear scan through input elements. It utilizes a hash map (`dict`) to store element values and their indices/frequencies for $O(1)$ fast access. Key operations include bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`) for fast bitmask state updates.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(C E + C + Q)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(C^2 + E)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
