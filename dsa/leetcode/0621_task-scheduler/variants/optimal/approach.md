## General
Given an array of CPU `tasks`, each labeled with a letter from A to Z, and a number `n`. Each CPU interval can be idle or allow the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: ther..., the algorithm executes a single-pass linear scan through input elements. It utilizes a hash map (`dict`) to store element values and their indices/frequencies for $O(1)$ fast access.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(T)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
