### Approach 1: Top-Down Dynamic Programming

**Intuition**

> **Note.** For this problem, we assume that you already know the fundamentals of dynamic programming and are figuring out how to apply it to a wide range of problems, such as this one. If you are not yet at this stage, we recommend checking out our relevant [Explore Card content on dynamic programming](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/dynamic-programming/) before coming back to this article.

Let's say we have an integer `num` and split it into two integers: `i` and `num - i`. The highest product possible would be `i * BEST`, where `BEST` is the highest product possible from splitting up `num - i`.

Notice that the variable `BEST` represents the original problem with a different input (`num - i`). This allows us to think in terms of dynamic programming. Let's define a function `dp(num)` that returns the highest possible product from splitting `num` up.

We have the following base cases for this function:

1. If `num == 1`, then it isn't possible to split the number up, so we just `return 1`.
2. If `num == 2`, then it would be better to not split the number at all, since the only possible split `1 * 1` is less than `2`, so just `return 2`. The exact same argument can be made for `num == 3`: the only possible split `1 * 2` is less than `3` itself, so just `return 3`.

Otherwise, we have two options:

1. Don't split the number up at all. We can initialize the answer as `ans = num`.
2. Split the number. We can try all possible splits. Iterate `i` from `2` until `num`. For each value of `i`, try to update `ans` with `i * dp(num - i)` if it is larger.

You may be thinking: what about the constraint where we need to have at least `2` integers? We need to check for 2 separate cases before performing the recursion.

1. If `n == 2`, we immediately return `1`. The only possible split is `1 * 1`.
2. If `n == 3`, we immediately return `2`. The only possible split is `1 * 2`.

We need to explicitly check for these cases before going into the recursion, otherwise, we would incorrectly return a larger answer since we initialize `ans = num`.

For all other values of `n`, the recursion will work. Take a look at the first few numbers:

- For `num = 4`, we can do `2 * 2 = 4`, which is not less than `4` itself.
- For `num = 5`, we can do `2 * 3 = 6`, which is not less than `5` itself.
- For `num = 6`, we can do `3 * 3 = 9`, which is not less than `6` itself.

As you can see, as `n` increases, the product from splitting becomes larger and larger, and thus we will always satisfy the requirement of needing to perform at least one split. The only cases where performing a split results in a lower product is `2, 3`.

This solution will work, but you may notice that it will end up in a lot of duplicated computation. We will end up calculating many states multiple times. For example, if we called `dp(15)`, it would make a call to `dp(12)` when calculating `3 * dp(12)`. If we later call `dp(14)`, it will also make a call to `dp(12)` when calculating `2 * dp(12)`. To avoid computing the same states multiple times, we will use a technique called memoization. The first time we calculate `dp(num)`, we will store the result. In the future, we can reference this result for `num` instead of having to recalculate it.

**Algorithm**

1. If `n <= 3`, then `return n - 1`.
2. Define a memoized function `dp(num)`:
    - Base case: if `num <= 3`, then `return num`.
    - Initialize `ans = num`. This is the case of not splitting the number at all.
    - Iterate `i` from `2` until `num`:
        - Try to update `ans` with `i * dp(num - i)` if it is larger.
    - Return `ans`.
3. Return `dp(n)`.

**Implementation**

> In Python, we use [@functools.cache](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.cache) to memoize our function.


```python
class Solution:
    def integerBreak(self, n: int) -> int:
        @cache
        def dp(num):
            if num <= 3:
                return num
            
            ans = num
            for i in range(2, num):
                ans = max(ans, i * dp(num - i))
            
            return ans

        if n <= 3:
            return n - 1
        
        return dp(n)
```


**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity: $$O(n^2)$$

    There are $$O(n)$$ possible states of `num` that `dp` can be called with. Due to memoization, we only calculate each state once. To calculate a state, we iterate from `2` until `num`, which costs up to $$O(n)$$. Thus, we have a time complexity of $$O(n^2)$$.

* Space complexity: $$O(n)$$

    The recursion call stack can grow up to $$O(n)$$. Also, we require $$O(n)$$ space to memoize the function.

### Approach 2: Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming

**Intuition**

We can implement the same algorithm iteratively. In top-down, we start at the answer `(num = n)` and work our way down to the base cases (`if num <= 3, return num`).

In bottom-up, we will start from these base cases and iterate toward the answer. We will use a table `dp` which is equivalent to the function from the previous approach. Here, `dp[num]` is equal to `dp(num)` from the previous approach.

We have a for loop for `num` starting from `4` and iterating to `n`. Each iteration of this loop represents a state, like a function call. We can calculate this state the same way we did in the previous approach, by checking all possible splits with a for loop over `i`.

**Algorithm**

1. If `n <= 3`, then `return n - 1`.
2. Create an array `dp` of length `n + 1`.
3. Set the base cases. For `i = 1, 2, 3`, set `dp[i] = i`.
4. Iterate `num` from `4` to `n`:
    - Initialize `ans = num`. This is the case of not splitting the number at all.
    - Iterate `i` from `2` until `num`:
        - Try to update `ans` with `i * dp[num - i]` if it is larger.
    - Set `dp[num] = ans`.
5. Return `dp[n]`.

**Implementation**


```python
class Solution:
    def integerBreak(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n <= 3:
            return n - 1
        
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)

        # Set base cases
        for i in [1, 2, 3]:
            dp[i] = i
            
        for num in range(4, n + 1):
            ans = num
            for i in range(2, num):
                ans = max(ans, i * dp[num - i])
            
            dp[num] = ans
        
        return dp[n]
```


**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity: $$O(n^2)$$

    There are $$O(n)$$ possible states of `num` that `dp` can be called with. We only calculate each state once, as we calculate one state per outer for loop iteration. To calculate a state, we iterate from `2` until `num`, which costs up to $$O(n)$$. Thus, we have a time complexity of $$O(n^2)$$.

* Space complexity: $$O(n)$$

    The table `dp` requires $$O(n)$$ space.

### Approach 3: Mathematics

**Intuition**

Interestingly, it is optimal to only split `n` into `2` and `3`! Why is this the case? The following is not a strict mathematical proof, but gives an intuition as to why we should only split `n` into `2` and `3`.

The [inequality of arithmetic and geometric means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AM-GM_Inequality) shows that to maximize the product of a set of numbers with a fixed sum, the numbers should all be equal. This means that we should split `n` into `a` copies of `x`. We have:

$$n = ax$$

So,

$$a = \frac{n}{x}$$

The product of these copies will be $$x^a$$, we will substitute $$a = \frac{n}{x}$$ and represent this function as $$f$$.

$$\Large{f(x) = x ^ \frac{n}{x}}$$.

We need to maximize this function. Let's start by taking the derivative of $$f$$ with respect to $$x$$ (here, $$\log$$ is the natural logarithm).

$$\Large{f'(x) = -nx ^ {\frac{n}{x} - 2} \cdot (\log{}x - 1)}$$

Now, we set this equal to `0` and solve for `x` to find a critical point.

$$\Large{-nx ^ {\frac{n}{x} - 2} \cdot (\log{}x - 1) = 0}$$

The term $$\Large{x ^ {\frac{n}{x} - 2}}$$ converges to `0` as `x` tends to `0`. However, we are clearly not interested in values of `x` less than `1`, as that would lead to a product less than `1`.

This means $$f = 0$$ when $$(\log{}x - 1) = 0$$. This is the case when $$x = e = 2.71828...$$.

$$f$$ is maximized at $$e$$. Unfortunately, $$e$$ is not an integer, and this problem is called Integer Break. The nearest integer is $$3$$, which suggests that we should try to use $$3$$ as much as we can.

For numbers that are not divisible by $$3$$, we will have remainders. This is where $$2$$ comes in. For example, when `n = 11`, the maximum product is `54 = 3 * 3 * 3 * 2`.

When we have `n = 4`, it is better to split it into `2 * 2` versus `3 * 1`. Thus, the strategy of splitting into as many 3s as we can only applies when `n > 4`. This brings us to our algorithm. As long as `n > 4`, keep splitting 3s. Once `n <= 4`, we can just multiply it directly with whatever product we have built up to that point.

Note that due to the constraint of needing to perform at least one split, we still need to account for the special cases when `n <= 3`.

**Algorithm**

1. If `n <= 3`, then `return n - 1`.
2. Initialize `ans = 1`.
3. While `n > 4`:
    - Multiply `ans` by 3.
    - Subtract `3` from `n`.
4. Return `ans * n`.

**Implementation**


```python
class Solution:
    def integerBreak(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n <= 3:
            return n - 1
        
        ans = 1
        while n > 4:
            ans *= 3
            n -= 3
        
        return ans * n
```


**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity: $$O(n)$$

    The while loop performs $$O(\frac{n}{3}) = O(n)$$ iterations.

* Space complexity: $$O(1)$$

    We aren't using any extra space other than a few integers.

### Approach 4: Equation

**Intuition**

Instead of manually multiplying by 3 repeatedly, we can use math to figure out how many 3s and 2s will make up the optimal product.

First, we will again consider the cases when `n <= 3` separately.

Now, for `n > 3`, we have three possibilities:

1. `n % 3 == 0`. If `n` is divisible by `3`, then we can simply just break it into $$\frac{n}{3}$$ 3s.
2. `n % 3 == 1`. If we were to break `n` into $$\frac{n}{3}$$ 3s, we would have a remainder of `1`. As mentioned in the previous approach, it would be better to combine this `1` with one of the 3s to form a sum of `4`, which we can break into `2 * 2`. In this case, we break `n` into $$\frac{n}{3} - 1$$ 3s, and two 2s.
3. `n % 3 == 2`. If we were to break `n` into $$\frac{n}{3}$$ 3s, we would have a remainder of `2`. We simply break `n` into $$\frac{n}{3}$$ 3s and a single 2.

**Algorithm**

1. If `n <= 3`, then `return n - 1`.
2. If `n % 3 == 0`, return $$\Large{3 ^ \frac{n}{3}}$$.
3. If `n % 3 == 1`, return $$\Large{3 ^ {\frac{n}{3} - 1} \cdot 4}$$.
4. Otherwise, return $$\Large{3 ^ \frac{n}{3} \cdot 2}$$.

**Implementation**


```python
class Solution:
    def integerBreak(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n <= 3:
            return n - 1
        
        if n % 3 == 0:
            return 3 ** (n // 3)
        
        if n % 3 == 1:
            return 3 ** (n // 3 - 1) * 4
        
        return 3 ** (n // 3) * 2
```


**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity: $$O(\log{}n)$$

    It may seem that this algorithm runs in $$O(1)$$, but exponentiation costs $$O(\log{}n)$$. Note that some languages may be implemented in a way that exponentiation on integers costs $$O(1)$$, but here we are considering the general algorithmic complexity of exponentiation.

* Space complexity: $$O(1)$$

    We aren't using any extra space other than a few integers.
