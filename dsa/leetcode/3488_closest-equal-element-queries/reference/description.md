## Description

You are given a **circular** array `nums` and an array `queries`.

For each query `i`, you have to find the following:

<ul>
	<li>The **minimum** distance between the element at index `queries[i]` and **any** other index `j` in the **circular** array, where `nums[j] == nums[queries[i]]`. If no such index exists, the answer for that query should be -1.</li>
</ul>

Return an array `answer` of the **same** size as `queries`, where `answer[i]` represents the result for query `i`.
