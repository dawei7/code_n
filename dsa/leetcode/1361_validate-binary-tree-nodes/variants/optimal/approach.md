## General
### Beginner-Friendly Intuition & Strategy
The core task in **Validate Binary Tree Nodes** is to You have `n` binary tree nodes numbered from `0` to $n - 1$ where node `i` has two children $\text{leftChild}[i]$ and $\text{rightChild}[i]$, return `true` if and only if **all** the given nodes form **exactly one** valid binary tree. The data is structured as a **Binary Tree** made of connected nodes. The algorithm traverses the tree recursively, visiting each node's left and right child pointers (`val`, `left`, `right`) to inspect or transform the tree structure.

### Step-by-Step Execution Guide
**Step 1: Setup & Initial State**  
We set up tracking variables (accumulators, counters, or pointers) to hold intermediate results as we process the input.  
**Step 2: Core Processing & Decisions**  
1. Iterate sequentially through each element in the input.  
2. Apply the operational rules to update running state variables.  
3. Continue until all elements are evaluated.  
**Step 3: Completion & Result Return**  
When processing finishes, the algorithm outputs the final validated solution.

### Why This Handles Edge Cases Gracefully
- **Single Element / Border Cases:** Loop bounds handle single items and empty inputs naturally without array index out-of-bounds exceptions.


## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n)$ — Detailed Analysis: The time complexity corresponds directly to the total number of operations required by the step-by-step execution loop described above.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(n)$ — Detailed Analysis: The space complexity reflects the auxiliary memory allocated for tracking structures, recursion stack depth, or hash maps during processing.
