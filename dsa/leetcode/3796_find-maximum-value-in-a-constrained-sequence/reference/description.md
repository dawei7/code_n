## Description

You are given an integer `n`, a 2D integer array `restrictions`, and an integer array `diff` of length `n - 1`. Your task is to construct a sequence of length `n`, denoted by `a[0], a[1], ..., a[n - 1]`, such that it satisfies the following conditions:

<ul>
	<li>`a[0]` is 0.</li>
	<li>All elements in the sequence are **non-negative**.</li>
	<li>For every index `i` (`0 <= i <= n - 2`), `abs(a[i] - a[i + 1]) <= diff[i]`.</li>
	<li>For each `restrictions[i] = [idx, maxVal]`, the value at position `idx` in the sequence must not exceed `maxVal` (i.e., `a[idx] <= maxVal`).</li>
</ul>

Your goal is to construct a valid sequence that **maximizes** the **largest** value within the sequence while satisfying all the above conditions.

Return an integer denoting the **largest** value present in such an optimal sequence.
