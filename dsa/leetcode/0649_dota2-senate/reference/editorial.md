### Overview

Let's simplify the problem statement.

> Given a string of characters, where each character represents a senator. Character `R` represents a Radiant senator and Character `D` represents a Dire senator.
> $\downarrow$
> A particular party wins if only senators of that party are **eligible** in the senate after all **eligible** senators have exercised their rights. A senator is eligible to exercise their right if they are not banned by a previous senator's action.
> $\downarrow$
> Let's label "exercised their rights" as "**Voting**".
> $\downarrow$
>  **Voting** is done from left to right. After the rightmost senator has voted, the voting process starts again from the leftmost senator, marking the beginning of the next Round. A senator cannot participate in any Round after they have been banned.
> $\downarrow$
>  Now, this "exercise their right", what we have labeled as "**Voting**", is a power that a senator has. By Voting, a senator can ban another senator restricting them from participating in the next Round.
> $\downarrow$
> Thus each senator will optimally use their power to help their party win. We have to assume that each senator is rational, and thus have to predict the Winner, "Radiant" or "Dire".

Now, since the problem description mentions that

> Every senator is smart enough and will play the **best strategy** for his own party.

Let's try to find this "*best strategy*".

A senator has to ban another senator to increase the chance of their party winning.

<details><summary> <b>Will they ever ban a senator from their own party? Click to Reveal.</b> </summary>
<p>

No, they won't. Because at last, they want all eligible senators to be from their own party.

Banning senators from their own party not only reduces the number of eligible senators from their party but also restricts one senator from their own party from banning a senator of the other party.

Thus, it's always better to ban a senator from the other party.

</p>
</details>

$\downarrow$

Hence, we can conclude that a senator will always ban an **opponent** senator. That being said, all **opponents** from the other party are potential targets for a senator to ban. And choosing one over the other can give different results.

For Example, let `senate` be "DRDRDR".

> This set of steps will give "Radiant" as the winner.
> !?!../Documents/649/649_DRDRDR_Radiant.json:1280,720!?!
> <br/>

> This set of steps will give "Dire" as the winner.
> !?!../Documents/649/649_DRDRDR_Dire.json:1280,720!?!
> <br/>

Thus different strategies can give different results.

<details><summary> <b> What then is the "best strategy" for a senator to ban an opponent senator? Click to Reveal.</b> </summary>
<p>

Using this "best strategy" we will be able to predict the only possible **unique** winner for a given `senate` string.

Let's try to analyze. What if we ban the next opponent senator? Are we gaining anything?

The answer intuitively is **Yes**. When we ban the next closest opponent senator, we are restricting one senator from the other party which they could have used to ban a senator from our party. Thus, proceeding with this strategy, we are not only eliminating one opponent senator but also trying to preserve our own senators.

Hence, the "*best strategy*" for a senator is to **ban the next closest opponent senator**.

</p>
</details>

$\downarrow$

This falls under the category of **Greedy**, whereby the "best strategy" is greedily chosen at each step in hope of local optimum.

Throughout the article, we will be using $N$ to denote the number of senators, which is the length of the `senate` string. Before proceeding further, let's try to figure out the maximum number of rounds that we can have.

<details><summary> <b> How many rounds can we have? Click to Reveal.</b> </summary>

<p>

There are $N$ senators, and each senator can ban one opponent senator. Thus, after every round, the number of senators will reduce by $\frac{N}{2}$.

Hence, in the first round, we will have $N$ senators. In the second round, we will have $\frac{N}{2}$ senators. In the third round, we will have $\frac{\frac{N}{2}}{2}$ senators. And so on.

This will be repeated until we have only one senator from either party.

Hence after every round, the length of the senate will be halved. Thus, the maximum number of rounds that we can have is $\log_{2}N$. The analysis is similar to [Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/binary-search/).

</p>
</details>

$\downarrow$

What perhaps is more interesting is the maximum number of votes that we can have in total.

<details><summary> <b> How many votes can we have? Click to Reveal.</b> </summary>

<p>

Let there be $N$ senators. In the first round, there will be at most $\frac{N}{2}$ votes. In the second round, there will be at most $\frac{\frac{N}{2}}{2}$ votes. And so on.

Thus, the total number of votes will
$\frac{N}{2} + \frac{\frac{N}{2}}{2} + \frac{\frac{\frac{N}{2}}{2}}{2} + ...$

which simplifies to
$\frac{N}{2} + \frac{N}{4} + \frac{N}{8} + ... + \frac{N}{2^k}$

where $k$ is the maximum number of rounds that we can have.

This can be approximated to

$\frac{N}{2} + \frac{N}{4} + \frac{N}{8} + ...$

where the number of terms is infinite.

Now, this is a geometric progression with common ratio $\frac{1}{2}$ and first term $\frac{N}{2}$. Thus, the [sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series#Sum) of this progression is

$\frac{N}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{N}{2} \cdot 2 = N$

Thus, the total number of votes that we can have is $N$.

Now, the question boils down to how to find the optimal (next closest) opponent senator **efficiently**. The article presents multiple approaches to solving this problem.

---

### Approach 1: Greedy

#### Intuition

As discussed above, the "*best strategy*" for a senator is to ban the next closest opponent senator. Thus, we can use a greedy approach to solve this problem.

For every "eligible senator", we can try to find the next closest opponent senator and ban it. To find this senator, we can linearly scan the `senate` string ahead of the "current senator", to the right. If no senator is found, we can start scanning from the left of the `senate` string until one position before the "current senator". If no senator is found, we can return the party of the "current senator" as the winner.

Also, to ban the next closest opponent senator, we can just remove the banned senator from the `senate` string.

Moreover, one minute optimization that we can do is to keep track of the number of senators from each party. If the number of senators from one party becomes zero, we can return the other party as the winner.

#### Algorithm

1. We need to remove banned senators from the `senate` string. If strings are immutable in your programming language, then convert the input to an equivalent mutable data structure (like a dynamic array).

2. Count the number of senators from each party, and store it in `rCount` and `dCount` respectively.

3. Define a function `ban(toBan, startAt)` which will ban the next closest opponent senator of type `toBan`, starting from the position `startAt` in the `senate` string. It will return a boolean value, which will be `True` if we have to loop around the `senate` string for banning the next closest opponent senator. This will help us in dealing with the indices of the `senate` string.

4. Define a variable `turn` which will keep track of the current senator. It will be an integer value, which will be the index of the current senator in the `senate` string. Initially, it will be `0`.

5. While we have senators from both parties, we will keep on banning the next closest opponent senator of the current senator at index `turn` in the `senate` string. We will keep on doing this as long as we still have senators from both parties.

    After banning, we will decrement the count of the banned senator's party by `1`.

*Also, if the senator was banned before this index, it means the senator having the next turn will be the senator at the same index. Only in this case, we will decrement the `turn` by `1`.*

    At last, we will increment the `turn` by `1`. Take `MOD` of `turn` with the length of the `senate` string, to handle the wrap-around by keeping it in the range of `0` to $\text{senate.length} - 1$.

6. If the number of senators of one party is 0, we can return the other party as the winner.

#### Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def predictPartyVictory(self, senate: str) -> str:

        # Converting to List as string is immutable, and we need to remove.
        # List will save only eligible senators
        senate = list(senate)

        # Count of Each Type of Senator to check for Winner
        r_count = senate.count('R')
        d_count = len(senate) - r_count

        # Ban the candidate "to_ban", immediate next to "start_at"
        # If have to loop around, then it means next turn will be of
        # senator at same index. Returns loop around boolean
        def ban(to_ban, start_at):

            loop_around = False
            pointer = start_at

            while True:
                if pointer == 0:
                    loop_around = True
                if senate[pointer] == to_ban:
                    senate.pop(pointer)
                    break
                pointer = (pointer + 1) % len(senate)

            return loop_around

        # Turn of Senator at this index
        turn = 0

        # While No Winner
        while r_count > 0 and d_count > 0:

            # Ban the next opponent, starting at one index ahead
            # Taking MOD to loop around
            if senate[turn] == 'R':
                banned_senator_before = ban('D', (turn + 1) % len(senate))
                d_count -= 1
            else:
                banned_senator_before = ban('R', (turn + 1) % len(senate))
                r_count -= 1

            # If the index of the banned senator is before current index,
            # then we need to decrement turn by 1, as we have removed
            # a senator from the list
            if banned_senator_before:
                turn -= 1

            # Increment turn by 1
            turn = (turn + 1) % len(senate)

        # Return Winner depending on the count
        return 'Radiant' if d_count == 0 else 'Dire'
```

#### Complexity Analysis

Let $N$ be the number of senators in the senate.

* Time complexity: $O(N^2)$.

- Counting the number of senators of each type is $O(N)$ time.

- As discussed in [Overview](#overview), there will be $O(N)$ turns/votes.
*Each turn will take $O(N)$ time to find the next senator to ban. Also, removing an element from an array is $O(N)$ time. Thus, **each turn** requires $O(2N)$ operations, which is $O(N)$ time.*
    Thus, $O(N)$ turns/votes requires $O(N^2)$ time.

    Hence, the overall time complexity will be $O(N + N^2) = O(N^2)$.

* Space complexity: $O(N)$.

    If the string is mutable, then we can do it in place.

    However, strings are often immutable. Thus, we need to use a new data structure of size $N$ to store the senate. Hence, the space complexity will be $O(N)$.

---

### Approach 2: Boolean Array

#### Intuition

The previous [approach](#approach-1-greedy) was not efficient enough and also suffers from nuances of string manipulation, particularly the deletion of characters and maintaining the `turn` invariant (decrementing if `loopAround`)

The main purpose of deletion was to maintain only the senators who are still eligible. If we are planning to NOT delete the banned senators, then we can use a boolean array to keep track of the senators who are banned.

This will also help us to maintain the `turn` invariant. We can simply increment the `turn` by 1 and take MOD to loop around. The size of the `senate` string will not change in this approach. Also, there is no need to maintain the `loopAround` boolean. Further, we don't need to convert the string to a character array.

As done in the previous approach too, we will keep track of the count of each type of senator. If any of the counts reaches 0, then we will return the winner.

#### Algorithm

1. Create a boolean array `banned` of size $N$ and initialize it to `false`. This will keep track of the senators who are banned.

2. Create a count of each type of senator, `rCount` and `dCount`.

3. Define a function `ban` which takes in the type of senator to ban, `toBan` and the index to start searching for the next senator to ban, `startAt`.

    Inside the function define a pointer `pointer` and initialize it to `startAt`. While an eligible senator of type `toBan` is not found, keep incrementing the `pointer` by 1 and taking MOD length $N$ to loop around.

    If found, ban the senator by setting $\text{banned}[pointer]$ to `true`.

    The loop will terminate because we will call the function only when there is at least one eligible senator of type `toBan` in the senate. Thus, we will always find an eligible senator of the type `toBan` in the senate.

4. Define a variable `turn` and initialize it to 0. This will keep track of the index of the senator whose turn it is.

5. While there is no winner, keep iterating over the senate.

    If the senator at `turn` is not banned, then check the type of the senator, and call the `ban` function with the type of the opponent senator and the index of the next senator, i.e. $(turn + 1) \% \text{senate.length}()$. After executing the `ban` function, decrement the count of the opponent senator by 1.

    Increment the `turn` by 1 and take MOD $N$ to loop around. If the senator at `turn` is banned, do this immediately without checking the type of the senator, otherwise do this after executing the `ban` function.

6. Return the winner depending on which senator's count has dropped to 0.

#### Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def predictPartyVictory(self, senate: str) -> str:

        # Number of Senators
        N = len(senate)

        # To mark Banned Senators
        banned = [False] * N

        # Count of Each Type of Senator who are not-banned
        r_count = senate.count('R')
        d_count = N - r_count

        # Ban the candidate "to_ban", immediate next to "start_at"
        def ban(to_ban, start_at):

            # Find the next eligible senator of "to_ban" type
            # On found, mark him as banned
            pointer = start_at
            while True:
                if senate[pointer] == to_ban and not banned[pointer]:
                    banned[pointer] = True
                    break
                pointer = (pointer + 1) % len(senate)

        # Turn of Senator at this Index
        turn = 0

        # While both parties have at least one senator
        while r_count > 0 and d_count > 0:

            if not banned[turn]:
                if senate[turn] == 'R':
                    ban('D', (turn + 1) % N)
                    d_count -= 1
                else:
                    ban('R', (turn + 1) % N)
                    r_count -= 1

            turn = (turn + 1) % N

        return 'Radiant' if d_count == 0 else 'Dire'

```

**Implementation Note :** Instead of using a boolean array to mark banned senators, we can use a `set` if it supports $O(1)$ lookup and addition.

#### Complexity Analysis

Let $N$ be the number of senators in the senate.

* Time complexity: $O(N^2)$.

- Counting the number of senators of each type is $O(N)$ time.

- As discussed in [Overview](#overview), there will be at most $N$ turns. Thus, $if !\text{banned}[turn]$ in `while (rCount > 0 && dCount > 0)` will be executed at most $N$ times.
*In each turn, we will iterate over the entire senate string to find the next eligible senator to ban. This is bounded by $N$ as well.*

    Thus, the overall time complexity is $O(N^2)$.

* Space complexity: $O(N)$.

    We use a boolean array of size $N$ to mark banned senators. However, compared to [previous approach](#approach-1-greedy), we have overcome the nuances of maintaining the `turn` invariant.

---

### Approach 3: Binary Search

#### Intuition

In the previous approach, the biggest bottleneck was the **search** for the next eligible senator to ban. We know that we can optimize any **search** using [**binary search**](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/binary-search/) provided the "search space" is sorted.

<details><summary> <b>What is sorted in this situation? Click to Reveal</b> </summary>

<p>

We know that the `senate` is not necessarily sorted. And we also even cannot sort it because we need to maintain the order of senators.

To analyze more let's rephrase the bottleneck

> Find the index of the next eligible opponent senator to ban.

Can we somehow, for every party, maintain a sorted list of indices of their eligible senators?
*Yes, we can maintain two sorted lists of indices of eligible senators of each party.*

And then, we can use binary search to find the next eligible senator to ban.

</p> </details>

Thus, using binary search, we can optimize the search for the next eligible senator to ban. Let's see if this will help us to improve the overall time complexity or not.

#### Algorithm

1. Declare a Boolean array `banned` of size $N$ to flag banned senators.

2. Declare two sorted lists `rIndices` and `dIndices` to maintain indices of **eligible senators** of each party.

3. Define a function `ban` which takes two arguments, `indicesArray` which is a list of indices of the opponent party, and `startAt` which indicates we have to find a senator ahead of (including) this index. This function will ban the next eligible senator.

    Using binary search, find the index of the next eligible senator to ban ahead of `startAt`. If not found ahead of `startAt`, we have to loop around, in this case, we can ban the first eligible senator.

    Since the `indicesArray` will store indices of **eligible senators** only. Therefore, after finding the index of the next eligible senator to ban, mark him as banned in the `banned` array and remove him from `indicesArray` to maintain the invariant.

    We will call this function only when `indicesArray` is not empty. Thus answer will always be found.

4. Initialize `turn` with 0 which indicates the index of the senator whose turn is next.

5. While both parties have at least one senator, do the following:

    If $\text{senate}[turn]$ is not banned, then find the next eligible senator to ban using the `ban` function. If $\text{senate}[turn]$ is `R`, then find the next eligible senator to ban from `dIndices` and vice versa. Start from the `turn` index to find the next eligible senator to ban.
*(We can start from $(turn + 1) \% \text{senate.length}()$ as well. But `turn` will work too because we know that $\text{senate}[turn]$ is from the same party but we want to ban the opponent party senator.)*

    Increment `turn` by $1$. Loop around by taking modulo with $N$ if needed.

6. Return the party which has at least one senator.

#### Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def predictPartyVictory(self, senate: str) -> str:

        # Number of Senators
        N = len(senate)

        # To mark Banned Senators
        banned = [False] * N

        # List of indices of Eligible Radiant and Dire Senators
        r_indices = [i for i in range(N) if senate[i] == 'R']
        d_indices = [i for i in range(N) if senate[i] == 'D']

        # Ban the senator of "indices" array next to "start_at"
        def ban(indices_array, start_at):

            # Find the index of "index of senator to ban" using Binary Search
            temp = bisect.bisect_left(indices_array, start_at)

            # If start_at is more than the last index,
            # then start from the beginning. Ban the first senator
            if temp == len(indices_array):
                banned[indices_array.pop(0)] = True

            # Else, Ban the senator at the index
            else:
                banned[indices_array.pop(temp)] = True

        # Turn of Senator at this Index
        turn = 0

        # While both parties have at least one senator
        while r_indices and d_indices:

            if not banned[turn]:
                if senate[turn] == 'R':
                    ban(d_indices, turn)
                else:
                    ban(r_indices, turn)

            turn = (turn + 1) % N

        return 'Radiant' if d_indices == [] else 'Dire'

```

**Implementation Note:** For Binary Search, we have used different inbuilt functions in different languages. More about them can be read from the official documentation.

- In Python, we have used the [$bisect.\text{bisect}_{left}$](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.bisect_left) function.
- In Java, we have used [`Collections.binarySearch`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html#binarySearch(int[],%20int)) function.
- In C++, we have used [$\text{lower}_{bound}$](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/lower_bound) function.
- In C#, we have used [`List.BinarySearch`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.list-1.binarysearch?view=net-5.0) function.

While there is variation in the different functions, the core idea remains the same. The function takes two parameters, an array `a` and a value `x`. It returns the index of the first element in `a` which is not less than `x`. If all elements in `a` are less than `x`, it returns the size of `a`. The algorithm is based on the fact that the array `a` is sorted.

#### Complexity Analysis

Let $N$ be the number of senators in the senate.

* Time complexity: $O(N^2)$.

- Creating the list of indices of eligible senators takes $O(N)$ time.

- The $if !\text{banned}[turn]$ condition in the `while (!rIndices.empty() && !dIndices.empty())` loop is executed $N$ times. Because there will be at most $O(N)$ vote as discussed in [Overview](#overview).

        Now, each vote will call the `ban` function. The `ban` function uses Binary Search to find the index of the senator to ban. The Binary Search takes $O(\log N)$ time. But, it is also removing the index from the list using the `erase` (or equivalent) function. This takes $O(N)$ time. So, the total time taken by the `ban` function is $O(N)$.

      Hence, the total time taken by the `while` loop is $O(N^2)$.

    Thus, the total time complexity is $O(N^2)$.

**Side Note :** **If** `popping` to maintain invariant of eligible senators was $O(1)$, then the time complexity would have been $O(N + N \log N) = O(N \log N)$.

* Space complexity: $O(N)$.

- The space taken by the `banned` array is $O(N)$.

- The space taken by the `rIndices` and `dIndices` array is $O(N)$.

- Thus, the total space complexity is $O(N)$.

### Approach 4: Two Queues

#### Intuition

The biggest drawback of [Approach 1](#approach-1-greedy) and [Approach 3](#approach-3-binary-search) is the deletion from the array which takes $O(N)$ time.

> Let's revisit [Approach 3](#approach-3-binary-search).
>
> - We need a boolean array `banned` to keep track of the banned senators. This helped the variable `turn` to move forward.
>
> - We need `rIndices` and `dIndices` to keep track of the eligible senators separately in sorted order. This helped us to find the next target to ban.

**Can we somehow combine these two? Is `banned` really needed? What do the `rIndices` and `dIndices` actually store?**

Let's say the first radiant senator from left is `r0` and the first dire senator from left is `d0`. Then, `rIndices` and `dIndices` will store the indices of `r0`, `r1`, `r2`, ..., `rp` and `d0`, `d1`, `d2`, ..., `dm` respectively.

- Since indices (`rIndices` and `dIndices`) are sorted, and they also cover the entire senate, we can say that the `turn` will be the minimum of the first index/element of `rIndices` and `dIndices` array.

- and who will be the next target to ban? The person with the first `turn` will choose the immediate next opponent. And where is it? It will be the maximum of the first index of the `rIndices` and `dIndices` array. Because the minimum one got the `turn` and the maximum (or other) one will get `banned`.

Thus, here comes the **key driving idea**. Take two arrays `rIndices` and `dIndices` to keep track of the indices of the eligible senators separately in sorted order. Take the first element *(which represent indices of senators)* of `rIndices` and `dIndices` and compare them.

- The minimum of these two will be the `turn`. It will not get banned, at least as of now. Thus, it will again be added to the array. Since it should get turn in the next round, we will add it to the end of the array, and the index will be $turn + n$ because, in the next round, this would be the first index.

- The maximum of these two will be the next target to ban. It will get banned. Thus, it will not be added back to the array.

Now, in this approach, we are removing the element from the front of the array and adding the element to the back of the array. This is nothing but the working principle of a [Queue](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/queue-stack/228/first-in-first-out-data-structure/). Removing from the front is DE-queuing and adding to back is EN-queuing.

[Queue](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/queue-stack/228/first-in-first-out-data-structure/) is an efficient data structure that can help us find the next closest opponent senator as well as the next eligible voter. It also helps us in simulating the voting process from left to right. Also, it is easier to keep track of rounds of voting by assuming the index increase by $N$ after each round.

#### Algorithm

1. Create two queues `rQueue` and `dQueue` to keep track of the eligible senators separately in sorted order.

2. Populate the queues with the indices of the respective senators from left to right.

3. While both parties have at least one Senator, do the following:

- Pop the Next-Turn Senator index from both queues.

- ONE having larger index will be banned by lower index. Thus, the lower index will again get Turn, so EN-Queue in the same queue with the index/turn increased by $N$.

4. Return the party name of the queue which is not empty.

#### Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def predictPartyVictory(self, senate: str) -> str:

        # Number of Senator
        n = len(senate)

        # Queues with Senator's Index.
        # Index will be used to find the next turn of Senator
        r_queue = deque()
        d_queue = deque()

        # Populate the Queues
        for i, s in enumerate(senate):
            if s == 'R':
                r_queue.append(i)
            else:
                d_queue.append(i)

        # While both parties have at least one Senator
        while r_queue and d_queue:

            # Pop the Next-Turn Senate from both Q.
            r_turn = r_queue.popleft()
            d_turn = d_queue.popleft()

            # ONE having a larger index will be banned by a lower index
            # Lower index will again get Turn, so EN-Queue again
            # But ensure its turn comes in the next round only
            if d_turn < r_turn:
                d_queue.append(d_turn + n)
            else:
                r_queue.append(r_turn + n)

        # One's which Empty is not the winner
        return "Radiant" if r_queue else "Dire"
```

**Implementation Note**

Python does not have a built-in Queue data structure. We can use [`deque`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque) from the `collections` module. `deque` is a double-ended queue that supports adding and removing elements from both ends in $O(1)$ time.

Also, we have EN-queued the eligible senator out of two by adding $N$ to the index. Although this new index is not necessarily the `turn` number because the number of senators in the senate can be less than $N$. But this is not a problem because we are only interested in ordering the senators, and not the actual `turn` number.

#### Complexity Analysis

Let $N$ be the number of senators in the senate.

* Time complexity: $O(N)$.

- Populating the queues takes $O(N)$ time.

- While loop will give chance to each eligible senator to vote until the last round. The voting process for one senator takes $O(1)$ time because of constant queue operations. There will be $O(N)$ such votes as discussed in [Overview](#overview) section.

- Hence, total time complexity is $O(N + N) = O(N)$.

* Space complexity: $O(N)$.

    Storing the index of senators in the queues takes $O(N)$ space. The queues will either decrease or remain the same in size in each round. They will never increase in size. Hence, space complexity is $O(N)$.

### Approach 5: Single Queue

#### Intuition

As clear from the heading, let's try to use a single queue of senators. The front of the queue will be the senator having the next turn.

We can pop the front of the queue.

- if the senator is eligible to vote, we can "float" the ban on the opponent senator. By "floating", we mean that we are not banning the opponent senator right now, but we are just making a note that we will ban the opponent senator if encountered in the future. This will also ensure that the banned senator is the immediate opponent of the current senator.

    After doing this, we can simply push the current senator to the back of the queue because it will again get a chance to vote in the next round.

- else if the senator is not eligible to vote because previously its opponent has "floated" a ban on it, we can simply ignore it. Banning is marked by NOT adding it again to the queue. Moreover, we can also decrement the floating ban count on this party.

Thus, this thought process ensures the implementation of the greedy approach by floating the ban.

A minute optimization, we can also maintain the count of "eligible senators" of each party, and decrement it when a senator is banned. This will help us to stop the voting process when one party has no eligible senators left.

#### Algorithm

1. Count the number of senators of each party. Let's call them `rCount` and `dCount`.

2. Initialize the floating ban count of each party to 0. Let's call them `rFloatingBan` and `dFloatingBan`.

3. Initialize a queue of senators with the order same as `senate`.

4. While both parties have at least one eligible senator, do the following:

1. Pop the next-turn senator from the queue.

2. If the senator is eligible to vote, then:

- Float the ban on the opponent party.

- Push the current senator to the back of the queue.

3. Else if the senator is not eligible to vote, then:

- Decrement the floating ban count of the party.

- Decrement the count of the party.

5. Return the party which has at least one eligible senator.

#### Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def predictPartyVictory(self, senate: str) -> str:

        # Eligible Senators of each party
        r_count = senate.count('R')
        d_count = len(senate) - r_count

        # Floating Ban Count
        d_floating_ban = 0
        r_floating_ban = 0

        # Queue of Senators
        q = deque(senate)

        # While any party has eligible Senators
        while r_count and d_count:

            # Pop the senator with turn
            curr = q.popleft()

            # If eligible, float the ban on the other party, enqueue again.
            # If not, decrement the floating ban and count of the party.
            if curr == 'D':
                if d_floating_ban:
                    d_floating_ban -= 1
                    d_count -= 1
                else:
                    r_floating_ban += 1
                    q.append('D')
            else:
                if r_floating_ban:
                    r_floating_ban -= 1
                    r_count -= 1
                else:
                    d_floating_ban += 1
                    q.append('R')

        # Return the party with eligible Senators
        return 'Radiant' if r_count else 'Dire'
```

**Implementation Note :** Python does not have a built-in Queue data structure. We can use [`deque`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque) from the `collections` module. `deque` is a double-ended queue that supports adding and removing elements from both ends in $O(1)$ time.

#### Complexity Analysis

Let $N$ be the number of senators in the senate.

* Time complexity: $O(N)$.

- Counting the number of senators of each party takes $O(N)$ time. So does populating the queue.

- The condition `while (rCount && dCount)` will be executed $O(N)$ times because they are the simulation of the voting process, which is bounded by $O(N)$ as discussed in [Overview](#overview) section.

        Inside the loop, there are $O(1)$ operations.

- So the total time complexity is $O(N + N) = O(N)$.

* Space complexity: $O(N)$.

    The Queue will have $N$ senators initially. The number can only decrease but can never increase. So the space complexity is $O(N)$.
