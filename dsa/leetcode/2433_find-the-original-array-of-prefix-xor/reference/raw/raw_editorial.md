### Approach 1: Using XOR Properties

**Intuition**

There exists an array `arr` of $N$ integers and we are given another array `pref` in which the `ith` index has the value as `pref[i] = arr[0] ^ arr[1] ^ ... ^ arr[i]`. We need to return the original array `arr` which will generate the array `pref` using the above XOR operations.

An important property of XOR that we can use to solve this problem is `a ^ a = 0`, i.e. the `XOR` of two same integers is equal to `0`. The value in the array `pref` at index `i` is equal to `arr[0] ^ arr[1] ^ ... ^ arr[i]`, and the value in the index `i + 1` is equal to `arr[0] ^ arr[1] ^ ... ^ arr[i] ^ arr[i + 1]`. Now, if we perform the `XOR` operation with `pref[i]` and `pref[i + 1]` the expression would be as shown below.

Note that we have also used the XOR [Associative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_property) & [Commutative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_property) properties while rearranging the expression in the above diagram to come at the result.

In the above XOR expression, each index has two terms except the `arr[i + 1]`, and hence all other terms will be evaluated to `0`. Thus the final expression will evaluate to `arr[i + 1]`. This happened because the terms `pref[i]` and `pref[i + 1]` have the same value expression except that `pref[i + 1]` has one more extra term which is the only remained term when XOR operation is performed.

Therefore, the $$i-\text{th}$$ index in the array `arr` can be found by taking the XOR of `pref[i]` and `pref[i - 1]`, also for index `i = 0` the value `arr[0]` will be equal to the `pref[0]` as the value expression for `pref[0]` is equal to `arr[0]` itself.

**Algorithm**

1. Initialize an empty array `arr` of size $N$, this will store the final result.
2. Assign `arr[0]` as `pref[0]`, because the XOR of all numbers on and before the `0th` index will be the same as the number itself.
3. Iterate over the indices from `1` to $N - 1$, and for each index `i`:
    1. Assign `pref[i] ^ pref[i - 1]` to `arr[i]`.
4. Return `arr`.

**Implementation**


```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findArray(vector<int>& pref) {
        int n = pref.size();
        
        vector<int> arr;
        arr.push_back(pref[0]);
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            arr.push_back(pref[i] ^ pref[i - 1]);
        }
        
        return arr;
    }
};
```


**Complexity Analysis**

Here, $N$ is the number of elements in the array `pref` or `arr`.

* Time complexity $O(N)$

  We are iterating over each element only once in the array `pref`, the XOR operation takes $O(1)$ and hence the total time complexity is equal to $O(N)$.

* Space complexity $O(N)$

  The only space required is the array `arr` to store the result, although the space to store the result is generally not considered as part of the space complexity. The total space complexity is equal to $O(N)$.

### Approach 2: Using XOR Properties, Space Optimized

**Intuition**

> Note: This approach requires altering the input which is not recommended in an interview setting, This approach has been added for the completion sake and should only be presented in an interview if explicitly asked.

To find the value at an index `i` in the array `arr` we need the values at indices `i` and `i - 1` in the array `pref`. In the previous approach, since we were iterating from left to right, we needed a separate array to store the values. This is because when we calculate the value of index `i`, we can't put it directly into the array `pref` to override `pref[i]`, because we need to use the original value of `pref[i]` again when we compute the value of `arr[i + 1]` later.

Therefore, instead of iterating from left to right, we will iterate from right to left and store the answers directly in the array `pref` itself. This way, when we store the value for index `i` in the `pref` using `pref[i] ^ pref[i - 1]` we don't need the value of `pref[i]` again. Because the next value to be calculated is at index `i - 1` which will be calculated as `pref[i - 1] ^ pref[i - 2]`. In this way, we can use the original input array `pref` itself to store the answer.

**Algorithm**

1. Iterate over the array `pref` from the index `N - 1` to `1` and for each index `i`, do:
    - `pref[i] = pref[i] ^ pref[i - 1]`
    - We don't need to do anything for index `0` as it will be returned as it is.
2. Return `pref`.

**Implementation**


```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findArray(vector<int>& pref) {
        int n = pref.size();
        
        for (int i = n - 1; i > 0; i--) {
            pref[i] = pref[i] ^ pref[i - 1];
        }
        
        return pref;
    }
};
```


**Complexity Analysis**

Here, $N$ is the number of elements in the array `pref` or `arr`.

* Time complexity $O(N)$

  We are iterating over each element only once in the array `pref`, the XOR operation takes $O(1)$ and hence the total time complexity is equal to $O(N)$.

* Space complexity $O(1)$

  No extra space is required to store the result. Therefore the total space complexity is constant.
