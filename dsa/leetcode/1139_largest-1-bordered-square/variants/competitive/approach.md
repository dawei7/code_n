## General
Given a 2D `grid` of `0`s and `1`s, return the number of elements in the largest **square** subgrid that has all `1`s on its **border**, or `0` if such a subgrid doesn't exist in the `grid`, the algorithm executes a single-pass linear scan through input elements. Key operations include bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`) for fast bitmask state updates. Edge case handling: guards against empty/null inputs via early returns.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(mnq)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(mn)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
