## General
Given A room is represented by a **0-indexed** 2D binary matrix `room` where a `0` represents an **empty** space and a `1` represents a space with an **object**. The top left corner of the room will be empty in all test cases, the algorithm executes depth-first search (DFS) recursion to explore valid decision branches. It utilizes a hash set (`set`) to track unique elements and prevent duplicate processing in $O(1)$ time. Edge case handling: applies modulo arithmetic to prevent integer overflow.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(mn)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(mn)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
