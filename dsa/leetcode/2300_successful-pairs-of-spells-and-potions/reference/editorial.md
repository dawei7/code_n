### Overview

Given two arrays `spells` and `potions`, we need to find for each `spell` how many `potions` will form a **successful pair**.
A spell and potion pair is considered successful if the product of their strengths is at least `success`.

### Approach 1: Sorting + Binary Search

#### Intuition

Let's assume for a given $\text{spell}$, we have,  $\text{spell} * \text{a = success}$
So, for all $\text{x}$, where $\text{x} \geq \text{a}$, the result, $\text{spell} * \text{x}$ will always be greater than or equal to $\text{success}$.

This suggests if we know the minimum potion, `minPotion` in the `potions` array, whose product with a given `spell` is more than or equal to `success`, then all the potions which are greater than `minPotion` will also form successful pairs with it.

Now let's find what will be the value of `minPotion`.
The product of `spell` and `minPotion` will be at least `success`.

$\implies \text{spell} * \text{minPotion} \geq \text{success}$
$\implies \text{minPotion} \geq \text{success / spell}$
$\implies \text{minPotion} = \text{ceil(success / spell)}$

Now to easily search for a value in an array, we can use **binary search** if the array is sorted.
Thus, we will sort the `potions` array and search the first index `index` of `minPotion` or the element just greater than `minPotion`.

As we know all the `potions` bigger than `minPotion` will also form a successful pair with the given `spell`,
Thus, all the `potions` whose product with `spell` is greater than or equal to `success` will be all the elements from index `index` till the last element.

This sums up that, we will sort the `potions` array, then for each `spell` in the `spells` array, using binary search we will find the `index` as discussed and count all the potions from `index` till the end as successful potions for the current `spell`.

#### Algorithm

1. Sort the `potions` array in ascending order.
2. Initialize variables:
- `answer`, an array to store the result.
- `m`, length of the `potions` array.
- `maxPotion`, the maximum value in the `potions` array.
3. For each `spell` in the `spells` array:
- Calculate the minimum potion strength required to make the spell successful as `minPotion` using the formula $minPotion = ceil(success / spell)$.
- If `minPotion` is greater than `maxPotion`, store `0` in the `answer` array and continue to the next spell.
- Otherwise, find the index of the first element in the `potions` array that is greater than or equal to `minPotion` using the inbuilt lower bound methods like $\text{lower}_{bound}()$, $bisect.\text{bisect}_{left}()$, `sort.SearchInts()`, etc. or by implementing it on your own.
- Calculate the number of successful pairs possible for the current `spell` as $(m - index)$.
- Store the result in the `answer` vector.
4. Return the `answer` array which contains the number of successful pairs for each `spell`.

#### Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def successfulPairs(self, spells: List[int], potions: List[int], success: int) -> List[int]:
        # Sort the potions array in increasing order.
        potions.sort()
        answer = []

        m = len(potions)
        maxPotion = potions[m - 1]

        for spell in spells:
            # Minimum value of potion whose product with current spell
            # will be at least success or more.
            minPotion = (success + spell - 1) // spell
            # Check if we don't have any potion which can be used.
            if minPotion > maxPotion:
                answer.append(0)
                continue
            # We can use the found potion, and all potion in its right
            # (as the right potions are greater than the found potion).
            index = bisect.bisect_left(potions, minPotion)
            answer.append(m - index)

        return answer
```

#### Complexity Analysis

Here, $n$ is the number of elements in the `spells` array, and $m$ is the number of elements in the `potions` array.

* Time complexity: $O((m + n) \cdot \log m )$
  - We sort the `potions` array which takes $O(m \log m)$ time.
  - Then, for each element of the `spells` array using binary search we find the respective `minPotion` which takes $O(\log m)$ time. So, for $n$ elements it takes $O(n \log m)$ time.
  - Thus, overall we take $O(m \log m + n \log m)$ time.

* Space complexity: $O(\log m)$ or $O(m)$
  - The output array `answer` is not considered as additional space usage.
  - But some extra space is used when we sort the `potions` array in place. The space complexity of the sorting algorithm depends on the programming language.
- In Python, the sort() method sorts a list using the Timsort algorithm which has $O(m)$ additional space where $m$ is the number of the elements.
- In C++ and Swift, the sort() function is implemented as a hybrid of Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and Insertion Sort, with a worst-case space complexity of $O(\log m)$.
- In Java, Arrays.sort() is implemented using a variant of the Quick Sort algorithm which has a space complexity of $O(\log m)$.
- In JavaScript, the space complexity of sort() is $O(\log m)$.
  - In Swift, we need to create an additional array for keeping sorted `potions` which will take $O(m)$ space.

### Approach 2: Sorting + Two Pointers

#### Intuition

Let's say for a given $\text{spell = a}$ and $\text{minPotion = b}$, we have,  $\text{spell} * \text{minPotion} = \text{success}$.
Then for a $\text{spell > a}$, the minimum required potion will be $\text{minPotion} \leq \text{b}$, (if we want result $\geq \text{success}$).

So, if the `spells` and `potions` arrays are sorted in increasing order,
and we know where the `minPotion` for the $i^{th}$ `spell` is present in the `potions` array, then the `minPotion` for the $(i + 1)^{th}$ `spell` will be present at the same or smaller index as for the $i^{th}$ `spell`.

We start with two pointers, **one pointing to the smallest spell** and the **other pointing to the largest potion**.
If the product of the current spell and potion is greater than or equal to `success`, then we keep on decreasing the second pointer to point to a smaller potion. We stop when they don't form a successful pair. Thus, we will have the second pointer pointing to the minimum required potion `minPotion` and we can count the number of potions that form the successful pairs with the current spell based on its index as we did in the previous approach.

![slide3](images/Slide3.PNG)

Now, when we move to the next spell, as the next spell is greater than the previous spell, the potions which made a successful pair with the previous spell will also form a successful pair with the current spell (as we incremented one number in the product of two numbers, thus their product's result will also increase; it will be greater than `success`).
Thus, we just need to continue decreasing the second pointer from its previous value until it points to the minimum required potion for the current spell again to count the potions.

![slide4](images/Slide4.PNG)

We continue the above steps until we cover all the spells.

#### Algorithm

1. Create an array of pairs `sortedSpells` with the first element of each pair being a spell strength and the second element being its original index in the `spells` array.
2. Sort the `sortedSpells` and the `potions` arrays in ascending order.
3. Initialize variables:
- `answer`, an array of size `spells.size()` to store the result.
- `m`, length of the `potions` array.
- `potionIndex`, an integer initialized to $m - 1$ to keep track of the index of the current potion in the `potions` array.
4. For each `spell` and its original `index` in the `sortedSpells` array:
- While we have not run out of potions and the product of the current `spell` strength and the strength of the potion at the `potionIndex` is greater than or equal to `success`, decrement `potionIndex` by `1`. We stop at `minPotion` for the current `spell`.
- Calculate the number of successful pairs possible for the current `spell` as $m - (potionIndex + 1)$ and store the result at the `index` position in the `answer` array.
5. Return the `answer` array which contains the number of successful pairs for each `spell`.

#### Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def successfulPairs(self, spells: List[int], potions: List[int], success: int) -> List[int]:
        sortedSpells = [(spell, index) for index, spell in enumerate(spells)]

        # Sort the 'spells with index' and 'potions' array in increasing order.
        sortedSpells.sort()
        potions.sort()

        answer = [0] * len(spells)
        m = len(potions)
        potionIndex = m - 1

        # For each 'spell' find the respective 'minPotion' index.
        for spell, index in sortedSpells:
            while potionIndex >= 0 and (spell * potions[potionIndex]) >= success:
                potionIndex -= 1
            answer[index] = m - (potionIndex + 1)

        return answer
```

#### Complexity Analysis

Here, $n$ is the number of elements in the `spells` array, and $m$ is the number of elements in the `potions` array.

* Time complexity: $O(n \log n + m \log m)$
  - We create an array `sortedSpells` which takes $O(n)$ time, and then sort the `sortedSpells` and `potions` arrays which take $O(n \log n)$ and $O(m \log m)$ time respectively.
  - Then using two pointers we iterate on each element of the `sortedSpells` and `potions` arrays once which will take $O(n + m)$ time.
  - Thus, overall we take $O(n \log n + m \log m)$ time.

* Space complexity: $O(n + \log m)$ or $O(n + m)$
  - The output array `answer` is not considered as additional space usage.
  - But we create an additional array `sortedSpells` which will take $O(n)$ space.
  - And some extra space is used when we sort the `sortedSpells` and `potions` array in place. The space complexity of the sorting algorithm depends on the programming language.
- In Python, the sort() method sorts a list using the Timsort algorithm which has $O(m)$ additional space where $m$ is the number of the elements.
- In C++ and Swift, the sort() function is implemented as a hybrid of Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and Insertion Sort, with a worst-case space complexity of $O(\log m)$.
- In Java, Arrays.sort() is implemented using a variant of the Quick Sort algorithm which has a space complexity of $O(\log m)$.
- In JavaScript, the space complexity of sort() is $O(\log m)$.
  - Thus, sorting uses either $O(\log n + \log m)$ or $O(n + m)$ space.
  - In Swift, we need to create an additional array for keeping sorted `potions` which will take an additional $O(m)$ space.
  - So, overall we usem $O(n + \log n + \log m) = O(n + \log m)$ or $O(n + n + m) = O(n + m)$ space.
