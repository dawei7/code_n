## Description

You are given an integer `n`, the number of nodes in a directed graph where the nodes are labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. Each edge is red or blue in this graph, and there could be self-edges and parallel edges.

You are given two arrays `redEdges` and `blueEdges` where:

<ul>
	<li>`redEdges[i] = [a_i, b_i]` indicates that there is a directed red edge from node `a_i` to node `b_i` in the graph, and</li>
	<li>`blueEdges[j] = [u_j, v_j]` indicates that there is a directed blue edge from node `u_j` to node `v_j` in the graph.</li>
</ul>

Return an array `answer` of length `n`, where each `answer[x]` is the length of the shortest path from node `0` to node `x` such that the edge colors alternate along the path, or `-1` if such a path does not exist.
