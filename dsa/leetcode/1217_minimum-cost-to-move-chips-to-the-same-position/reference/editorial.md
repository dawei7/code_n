### Approach 1: Moving Chips Cleverly

**Intuition**

Notice that we have two types of costs:

1. Costs `0` when moving to $\text{position}[i] + 2$ or $\text{position}[i] - 2$.
2. Costs `1` when moving to $\text{position}[i] + 1$ or $\text{position}[i] - 1$.

Since move to $\text{position}[i] + 2$ or $\text{position}[i] - 2$ is free, it is natural to think that firstly moving chips as close as possible, with 0 cost.

**In fact, we can move all chips at even positions to position `0`, and move all chips at the odd positions to position `1`.**

Then, we only have many chips at position `0` and other chips at position `1`. Next, we only need to move those two piles together.

Given two piles of chips located at `0` and `1` respectively, intuitively it would be less effort-taking (i.e. less cost) to move the smaller pile to the larger one, which makes the total cost to:

$Cost = min(even\_cnt, odd\_cnt)$

where $even\_cnt$ represents the number of chips at the even positions, and $odd\_cnt$ represents the number of chips at the odd positions.

Good, now we have a not bad cost. Can we do better?

Well, now we will prove that this cost is the smallest possible one.

> As for the final position of those chips pile, there are only two possibilities:
> 1. The final position is at the even position, or
> 2. The final position is at the odd position.
>
> In the first case, we at least need to cost $\text{odd}_{cnt}$ to move all the chips at the odd positions to the even positions.
> Similarly, in the second case, we at least need to cost $\text{even}_{cnt}$.
>
> Therefore, $min(\text{even}_{cnt}, \text{odd}_{cnt})$ is the smallest possible cost.

In conclusion, the policy we gave above will achieve the smallest possible cost. What we need to return is just $min(\text{even}_{cnt}, \text{odd}_{cnt})$.

**Algorithm**

We just need to count the number of chips at the even positions and the number of chips at the odd positions and return the smaller one.

```python
class Solution:
    def minCostToMoveChips(self, position: List[int]) -> int:
        even_cnt = 0
        odd_cnt = 0
        for i in position:
            if i % 2 == 0:
                even_cnt += 1
            else:
                odd_cnt += 1
        return min(even_cnt, odd_cnt)
```

You can also count either the odd or the even numbers, and then deduct that number from the length to obtain the other one.

**Complexity Analysis**

Let $N$ be the length of `position`.

- Time Complexity : $\mathcal{O}(N)$ since we need to iterate `position` once.

- Space Complexity : $\mathcal{O}(1)$ since we only use two ints: $\text{even}_{cnt}$ and $\text{odd}_{cnt}$.
