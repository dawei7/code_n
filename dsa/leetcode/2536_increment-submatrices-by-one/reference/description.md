## Description

You are given a positive integer `n`, indicating that we initially have an `n x n` **0-indexed** integer matrix `mat` filled with zeroes.

You are also given a 2D integer array `query`. For each `query[i] = [row1_i, col1_i, row2_i, col2_i]`, you should do the following operation:

<ul>
	<li>Add `1` to **every element** in the submatrix with the **top left** corner `(row1_i, col1_i)` and the **bottom right** corner `(row2_i, col2_i)`. That is, add `1` to `mat[x][y]` for all `row1_i <= x <= row2_i` and `col1_i <= y <= col2_i`.</li>
</ul>

Return* the matrix* `mat`* after performing every query.*
