## Description

You are given an array of **distinct** positive integers locations where $\text{locations}[i]$ represents the position of city `i`. You are also given integers `start`, `finish` and `fuel` representing the starting city, ending city, and the initial amount of fuel you have, respectively.

At each step, if you are at city `i`, you can pick any city `j` such that $j \neq i$ and $0 \le j < \text{locations.length}$ and move to city `j`. Moving from city `i` to city `j` reduces the amount of fuel you have by $|\text{locations}[i] - \text{locations}[j]|$. Please notice that `|x|` denotes the absolute value of `x`.

Notice that `fuel` **cannot** become negative at any point in time, and that you are **allowed** to visit any city more than once (including `start` and `finish`).

Return *the count of all possible routes from *`start` *to* `finish`. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo $10^{9} + 7$.
### Function Contract

- `n`: Input parameter.
- Returns expected result.

### Examples

#### Example 1

- **Input:** $locations = [2,3,6,8,4], start = 1, finish = 3, fuel = 5$
- **Output:** `4`
- **Explanation:** The following are all possible routes, each uses 5 units of fuel:
1 -> 3
1 -> 2 -> 3
1 -> 4 -> 3
1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3
#### Example 2

- **Input:** $locations = [4,3,1], start = 1, finish = 0, fuel = 6$
- **Output:** `5`
- **Explanation:** The following are all possible routes:
1 -> 0, used fuel = 1
1 -> 2 -> 0, used fuel = 5
1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0, used fuel = 5
1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0, used fuel = 3
1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0, used fuel = 5
#### Example 3

- **Input:** $locations = [5,2,1], start = 0, finish = 2, fuel = 3$
- **Output:** `0`
- **Explanation:** It is impossible to get from 0 to 2 using only 3 units of fuel since the shortest route needs 4 units of fuel.
### Constraints

- $2 \le \text{locations.length} \le 100$

- $1 \le \text{locations}[i] \le 10^{9}$

- All integers in `locations` are **distinct**.

- $0 \le start, finish < \text{locations.length}$

- $1 \le fuel \le 200$
