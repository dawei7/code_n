## Description

You are given two 2D integer arrays, `items1` and `items2`, representing two sets of items. Each array `items` has the following properties:

<ul>
	<li>`items[i] = [value_i, weight_i]` where `value_i` represents the **value** and `weight_i` represents the **weight **of the `i^th` item.</li>
	<li>The value of each item in `items` is **unique**.</li>
</ul>

Return *a 2D integer array* `ret` *where* `ret[i] = [value_i, weight_i]`*,* *with* `weight_i` *being the **sum of weights** of all items with value* `value_i`.

**Note:** `ret` should be returned in **ascending** order by value.
