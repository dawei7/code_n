## General
Given a **0-indexed** string `s` and a dictionary of words `dictionary`. You have to break `s` into one or more **non-overlapping** substrings such that each substring is present in `dictionary`. There may be some **extra c..., the algorithm executes a single-pass linear scan through input elements. It utilizes a hash map (`dict`) to store element values and their indices/frequencies for $O(1)$ fast access, a dynamic programming memoization table to cache intermediate subproblem states.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n^2 + W)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(n + W)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
