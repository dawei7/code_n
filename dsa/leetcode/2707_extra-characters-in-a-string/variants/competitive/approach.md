## General
### Beginner-Friendly Intuition & Strategy
The core task in **Extra Characters in a String** is to a **0-indexed** string `s` and a dictionary of words `dictionary`. You have to break `s` into one or more **non-overlapping** substrings such that each substring is present in `dictionary`. There may be some **extra characters** in `s` which are not present in any of the subst.... Instead of recalculating the exact same subproblems over and over again, this solution uses **Dynamic Programming**. We break the larger problem down into smaller overlapping subproblems, solve each subproblem once, and store its result in a memory table. When building the final answer, we simply look up previously calculated answers.

### Step-by-Step Execution Guide
**Step 1: Setup & Base Cases**  
We initialize an empty hash map (`dict`) to act as our fast memory bank, storing elements and their indices or frequencies.  
**Step 2: Core Processing & Traversal**  
1. Loop through each item in the input.  
2. Calculate target complement.  
3. Check if complement exists in hash map for $O(1)$ match.  
4. Store current value in hash map if not found.  
**Step 3: Completion & Return**  
When processing finishes, the algorithm outputs the final validated solution.

### Why This Handles Edge Cases Gracefully
- **Single Element / Border Cases:** Loop bounds handle single items and empty inputs naturally.


## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n^2 + W)$ — Detailed Analysis: The time complexity corresponds directly to the total number of operations required by the step-by-step execution loop described above.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(n + W)$ — Detailed Analysis: The space complexity reflects the auxiliary memory allocated for tracking structures, recursion stack depth, or hash maps during processing.
