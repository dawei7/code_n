## Description

You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array of `events` where `events[i] = [startTime_i, endTime_i, value_i]`. The `i^th` event starts at `startTime_i`_ and ends at `endTime_i`, and if you attend this event, you will receive a value of `value_i`. You can choose **at most** **two** **non-overlapping** events to attend such that the sum of their values is **maximized**.

Return *this **maximum** sum.*

Note that the start time and end time is **inclusive**: that is, you cannot attend two events where one of them starts and the other ends at the same time. More specifically, if you attend an event with end time `t`, the next event must start at or after `t + 1`.
