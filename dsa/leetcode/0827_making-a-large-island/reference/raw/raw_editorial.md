### Approach 1: Using DFS

#### Intuition

We are given a binary matrix where each cell is either `0` (representing water) or `1` (representing land) and the ability to flip at most one `0` to `1`. Our task is to find the largest island in the matrix, or in other words, the largest group of `1`s connected with each other either up, down, left, or right (4-directionally) after the flip operation.

At first, we might think of flipping each `0` to `1` and then calculating the size of the largest island in the modified matrix. However, this brute-force approach is inefficient, especially for larger grids, as it involves multiple recalculations for each flip, which would lead to Time Limit Exceeded (TLE) error.

Instead of recalculating island sizes for every flip, we can take advantage of the fact that flipping a single `0` only affects the islands adjacent to it. Specifically, flipping a `0` merges neighboring islands into one larger island. This insight allows us to efficiently compute the largest island after flipping by precomputing the sizes of all islands first.

Check out the diagram below, where we can see that we can merge two islands into one by flipping a zero in between.

![make_large_island](images/make_large_island.png)

We start by traversing the grid and identifying all the islands using Depth-First Search (DFS). During this traversal, we give each island a unique identifier (like a color). At the same time, we also calculate and store the size of each island in a map, where the key is the island’s unique identifier and the value is its size. This precomputation allows us to avoid recalculating island sizes later.

> For a more comprehensive understanding of depth-first search, check out the [DFS Explore Card](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/graph/619/depth-first-search-in-graph/).

After labeling the islands and knowing their sizes, we then look at each `0` in the grid. Flipping a `0` to `1` might connect neighboring islands, creating a larger island. For each `0`, we examine the islands around it and collect their unique identifiers using a set (to avoid counting the same island more than once). We then sum up the sizes of these islands to calculate the size of the new island that would be formed if this `0` were flipped to `1`.

As we evaluate each potential flip, we compare the size of the island that would be formed with the largest island we’ve seen so far. This ensures that we find the largest possible island we can form by flipping a single `0`. We will handle special edge cases (e.g., the grid is full with `1`s or `0`s) separately.

This strategy is efficient because the grid is only traversed twice:
1. To label the islands and compute their sizes.
2. To evaluate the potential island size for each `0` flip.

#### Algorithm

##### `exploreIsland` helper function:

- Define the `exploreIsland` function which recursively explores an island with the given id `islandId` starting from the given cell `(currentRow, currentColumn)`.

- Check if the current cell is out of bounds, is not part of an island or is already visited (i.e., its value is not `1`):
  - If so, return `0`, indicating no land is found at this cell.

- Mark the current cell with the given `islandId` to indicate it has been visited.

- Recursively explore the four neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) and accumulate the area of the island:
  - Call `exploreIsland` for the cell below `(currentRow + 1, currentColumn)`.
  - Call `exploreIsland` for the cell above `(currentRow - 1, currentColumn)`.
  - Call `exploreIsland` for the cell to the right `(currentRow, currentColumn + 1)`.
  - Call `exploreIsland` for the cell to the left `(currentRow, currentColumn - 1)`.

- Return the total area of the island (i.e., 1 + the sum of all reachable land cells from the current position).

##### `largestIsland` main function:

- Initialize `islandSizes` to store sizes of islands, and `islandId` starting at `2` (to mark islands).

- Traverse through the grid to mark all islands and calculate their sizes:
  - For each cell in the grid, if the cell contains a land (value `1`), call `exploreIsland()` to mark the island and calculate its size.
  - For each island, store the size in `islandSizes` using the `islandId` as the key and increment `islandId` for the next island.

- Check if there are no islands (empty grid), in which case return 1 (since flipping one `0` would form a new island).

- If only one island exists in the entire grid, check if the size of that island is equal to the total grid size:
  - If true, return the size of the island.
  - Otherwise, return the size of the island + 1 (as we can expand the island by flipping one `0`).

- Initialize `maxIslandSize` to 1, which will store the size of the largest island.

- Traverse through the grid again to try converting each `0` to a `1` and calculate the resulting island size:
  - For each `0`, check its neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) to find which islands are connected to it.
  - Use a unordered set to store unique neighboring island IDs.
  - Sum the sizes of all unique neighboring islands and add 1 (to account for the flipped `0` turning into a `1`).
  - Update `maxIslandSize` with the maximum island size found.

- Return `maxIslandSize`, the size of the largest island after trying to expand all possible `0`s.

#### Complexity Analysis

Let $n$ be the number of rows in the grid, $m$ be the number of columns in the grid.

- Time complexity: $O(n \times m)$

    The algorithm consists of two main phases. In the first phase, we iterate over every cell in the grid to identify and mark islands using a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach. During this process, each cell is visited at most once, ensuring that the DFS traversal contributes $O(n \times m)$ to the time complexity. 
    
    In the second phase, we iterate over every cell again to explore the possibility of converting each `0` to `1` and calculating the potential island size. For each `0`, we check its four neighboring cells, which is a constant-time operation. The use of an unordered set ensures that neighboring islands are counted uniquely, and the total work done in this phase is also $O(n \times m)$. 
    
    Thus, the overall time complexity is dominated by the grid traversal and DFS, resulting in $O(n \times m)$.

- Space complexity: $O(n \times m)$

    The space complexity is primarily determined by the recursion stack used during the DFS traversal and the storage required for the unordered map that keeps track of island sizes. In the worst case, the recursion depth of the DFS can be $O(n \times m)$ if the entire grid forms a single large island. The unordered map stores the sizes of all islands, and in the worst case, the number of islands can be proportional to the number of cells, contributing $O(n \times m)$ to the space complexity. 

    Furthermore, the unordered set used to store neighboring islands for each `0` cell has a maximum size of 4, as there are only four possible neighboring cells. This does not significantly impact the overall space complexity. 
    
    Therefore, the dominant factors are the recursion stack and the unordered map, resulting in an overall space complexity of $O(n \times m)$.

### Approach 2: Using Disjoint Set Union (DSU)

#### Intuition

Another way to solve this problem is by using a data structure called [Disjoint Set Union (DSU)](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/graph/618/disjoint-set/), also known as Union-Find. 

In DSU, the main goal is to keep track of groups (or sets) of elements where each set has a representative. The key operations in DSU are:  
1. **Find**: This operation helps to find the representative (or "leader") of the set to which an element belongs. If two elements are in the same set, they will have the same representative.  
2. **Union**: This operation merges two sets together. If two elements belong to different sets, they are combined into a single set, and the representative of one set becomes the representative of the merged set.

The idea behind DSU is that we represent each island as a set, and then we merge islands when we encounter an adjacent land cell. This helps us keep track of which cells belong to which island and how big each island is.

First, we initialize a DSU structure where each land cell is its own representative (each cell is its own island), meaning that  `parent[node] = node` for every land cell node. We also initialize the `islandSize` array, where each island starts with a size of 1 (since each island is just one land cell initially). This is represented as `islandSize[node] = 1`.

As we traverse the grid, whenever we encounter a land cell (`1`), we check its adjacent cells (up, down, left, right). If an adjacent cell is also land, we union their corresponding sets. This means we merge the two islands (sets) into one larger island. The merging process ensures that the larger island becomes the representative of the merged set, keeping the data structure efficient.

During the merging step, we also update the size of the new island (set) by adding the size of the two merged islands. This is done by maintaining the `islandSize` array, where `islandSize[node]` is updated after each union operation.

After the initial union of all adjacent land cells, we then evaluate the potential effect of flipping a `0` (water) cell to `1` (land). When flipping a `0` to `1`, it will create a new island that merges with its adjacent islands (if any). To calculate the size of the new island formed by flipping a `0`, we simply look at the neighboring islands (sets) and calculate the size of the combined island. We do this by finding the representatives of the neighboring sets using find operations and summing their sizes.

As we evaluate each potential flip, we keep track of the largest island size encountered. If the grid is already filled with `1`s or `0`s, we handle these edge cases accordingly, but the main idea remains to maximize the island size formed by flipping a single `0`.

#### Algorithm

##### Define the `DisjointSet` class:

- Initialize `parent` and `islandSize` arrays:
  - `parent` stores the parent of each node.
  - `islandSize` stores the size of the connected island for each root.

- Initialize the `DisjointSet` constructor with `n` elements:
  - For each node from `l` to `n-1`:
    - Set `parent[node] = node`, meaning each node is initially its own parent.
    - Set `islandSize[node] = 1`, indicating each island starts with size 1.

- Implement `findRoot` function with path compression:
  - If the current node is its own parent, return the node as the root.
  - Otherwise, recursively find the root of the parent and apply path compression by updating the parent of the node.

- Implement `unionNodes(nodeA, nodeB)` function to union two sets based on size:
  - Find the roots of both `nodeA` and `nodeB` using the `findRoot` function.
  - If both nodes are already in the same set (i.e., have the same root), do nothing.
  - Otherwise, union the sets by size:
    - Attach the smaller island to the larger one:
      - If the island of `nodeA` is smaller, set `parent[rootA] = rootB` and update the size of `rootB`’s island.
      - If the island of `nodeB` is smaller, set `parent[rootB] = rootA` and update the size of `rootA`’s island.

##### In the given `Solution` class:

- Initialize `rows` and `columns` to store the grid's dimensions.

- Initialize a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) for the entire grid with `rows * columns` size.

- Define direction arrays (`rowDirections`, `columnDirections`) for traversing up, down, left, and right.

Step 1: Union adjacent `1`s in the grid:
  - Iterate through each cell in the grid:
    - If the current cell contains `1`, calculate the flattened 1D index for the current cell, as `(columns * currentRow) + currentColumn`.
    - For each of the four possible directions (up, down, left, right), check if the neighbor is within bounds and also contains `1`.
    - If the neighbor is valid, flatten the 2D index and use the DSU to union the current cell and the neighbor.

Step 2: Calculate the maximum possible island size:
  - Initialize `maxIslandSize` to store the largest island size and `hasZero` as a flag to check if there are any zeros in the grid.
  - Initialize a `uniqueRoots` set to store the unique roots of neighboring `1`s for each `0` in the grid.
  - Iterate through the grid to find all zeros (`0` cells):
    - For each `0`, initialize the `currentIslandSize` to `1` (since we are flipping the `0`).
    - For each direction (up, down, left, right), check if the neighboring cell contains `1` and if so, add the root of the neighboring island to `uniqueRoots`.
    - Sum the sizes of the unique neighboring islands using their roots.
    - Update `maxIslandSize` with the largest island size found.

Step 3: Return the result:
  - If there are no zeros in the grid, return the size of the entire grid (i.e., `rows * columns`).
  - Otherwise, return `maxIslandSize`, the largest island size after flipping a zero.

#### Complexity Analysis

Let $n$ be the number of rows in the grid, $m$ be the number of columns in the grid.

- Time complexity: $O(n \times m)$

    The algorithm consists of two main phases. In the first phase, we iterate over every cell in the grid and we use a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to union adjacent `1`s. For each cell, we check its four neighboring cells, which is a constant-time operation. The DSU operations, including `findRoot` and `unionNodes`, are nearly constant time due to path compression and union by size optimizations. Thus, the first phase contributes $O(n \times m)$ to the time complexity. 
    
    In the second phase, we iterate over every cell again to explore the possibility of converting each `0` to `1` and calculating the potential island size. For each `0`, we check its four neighboring cells and use the DSU to find the roots of neighboring islands. The unordered set ensures that neighboring islands are counted uniquely, and the total work done in this phase is also $O(n \times m)$. 
    
    Therefore, the overall time complexity is dominated by the grid traversal and DSU operations, resulting in $O(n \times m)$.

- Space complexity: $O(n \times m)$

    The space complexity is primarily determined by the DSU data structure, which stores the parent and size of each cell. Both the `parent` and `islandSize` arrays require $O(n \times m)$ space. Additionally, the unordered set used to store unique roots for neighboring islands has a maximum size of 4, as there are only four possible neighboring cells. This does not significantly impact the overall space complexity. 
    
    Therefore, the dominant factor is the DSU data structure, resulting in an overall space complexity of $O(n \times m)$.
