### 1. Description

There are several pistons in an old car engine, and we want to calculate the **maximum** possible area **under** the pistons.

You are given:

- An integer `height`, representing the **maximum** height a piston can reach.

- An integer array `positions`, where $\text{positions}[i]$ is the current position of piston `i`, which is equal to the current area **under** it.

- A string `directions`, where $\text{directions}[i]$ is the current moving direction of piston `i`, `'U'` for up, and `'D'` for down.

Each second:

- Every piston moves in its current direction 1 unit. e.g., if the direction is up, $\text{positions}[i]$ is incremented by 1.

- If a piston has reached one of the ends, i.e., $\text{positions}[i] = 0$ or $\text{positions}[i] = height$, its direction will change.

Return the *maximum possible area* under all the pistons.

### 2. Function Contract

- Refer to method signature.

### 3. Examples

#### Example 1

- **Input:** height = 5, positions = [2,5], directions = "UD"

- **Output:** 7

- **Explanation:** The current position of the pistons has the maximum possible area under it.

#### Example 2

- **Input:** height = 6, positions = [0,0,6,3], directions = "UUDU"

- **Output:** 15

- **Explanation:** After 3 seconds, the pistons will be in positions `[3, 3, 3, 6]`, which has the maximum possible area under it.

### 4. Constraints

- $1 \le height \le 10^{6}$

- $1 \le \text{positions.length} = \text{directions.length} \le 10^{5}$

- $0 \le \text{positions}[i] \le height$

- $\text{directions}[i]$ is either `'U'` or `'D'`.
