## Description

You are given three integers `<font face="monospace">m</font>`, `<font face="monospace">n</font>`, and `k`.

There is a rectangular grid of size `m × n` containing `k` identical pieces. Return the sum of Manhattan distances between every pair of pieces over all **valid arrangements** of pieces.

A **valid arrangement** is a placement of all `k` pieces on the grid with **at most** one piece per cell.

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

The Manhattan Distance between two cells `(x_i, y_i)` and `(x_j, y_j)` is `|x_i - x_j| + |y_i - y_j|`.
