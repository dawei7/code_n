### 1. Description

You are given an integer array `ranks` where $\text{ranks}[i]$ represents the rank of the $i^{\text{th}}$ student arriving **in order**. A lower number indicates a **better** rank.

Initially, the first student is **selected** by default.

A **replacement** occurs when a student with a **strictly** better rank arrives and **replaces** the current selection.

Return the total number of replacements made.

### 2. Function Contract

- Refer to method signature.

### 3. Examples

#### Example 1

- **Input:** ranks = [4,1,2]

- **Output:** 1

- **Explanation:** 

- The first student with $\text{ranks}[0] = 4$ is initially selected.

- The second student with $\text{ranks}[1] = 1$ is better than the current selection, so a replacement occurs.

- The third student has a worse rank, so no replacement occurs.

- Thus, the number of replacements is 1.

#### Example 2

- **Input:** ranks = [2,2,3]

- **Output:** 0

- **Explanation:** 

- The first student with $\text{ranks}[0] = 2$ is initially selected.

- Neither of $\text{ranks}[1] = 2$ or $\text{ranks}[2] = 3$ is better than the current selection.

- Thus, the number of replacements is 0.

### 4. Constraints

- $1 \le \text{ranks.length} \le 10^{5}$

- $1 \le \text{ranks}[i] \le 10^{5}$
