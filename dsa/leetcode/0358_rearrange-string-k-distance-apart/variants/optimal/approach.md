## General
Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, rearrange `s` such that the same characters are **at least** distance `k` from each other. If it is not possible to rearrange the string, return an empty string `""`, the algorithm executes breadth-first search (BFS) level-order traversal using a queue. It utilizes a hash map (`dict`) to store element values and their indices/frequencies for $O(1)$ fast access, a double-ended queue (`deque`) to support dynamic $O(1)$ push and pop operations at both ends, a priority queue (`heapq`) to maintain dynamic minimum/maximum element ordering. Edge case handling: guards against empty/null inputs via early returns.

## Complexity detail
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n)$ — Operation count bound.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$ — Auxiliary memory allocation bound.
