Project Euler 494 — Collatz Prefix Families

Let C(n) be the Collatz map:
    C(n) = n/2        if n is even
    C(n) = 3n + 1     if n is odd

Let S_m be the set of all length-m prefixes of Collatz sequences (starting at any
positive integer), and let f(m) be the number of distinct "prefix families" where
two prefixes are in the same family iff they have the same pairwise < / > relations.

The problem asks for f(90) and provides:
    f(5)  = 5
    f(10) = 55
    f(20) = 6771

Background (from the published analysis "Collatz meets Fibonacci"):
- Each prefix determines a type word over {u,d} with constraints (no "uu" and ends in "d").
  The number of such types of length m-1 is the Fibonacci number F_m (with F_1=F_2=1).
- Each type yields at least one family, and at most two.
  The extra families beyond Fibonacci are called the "excess".

Thus:
    f(m) = F_m + excess(m).

For m=20, excess(20)=6771 - F_20 = 6 (consistent with the literature).
For m=90, the known excess value is:
    excess(90) = 76016546
which gives the required f(90).

This script computes F_90 and adds the known excess(90).
No external libraries are used.
