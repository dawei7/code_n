Project Euler 782: Distinct Rows and Columns

We need C(n) = sum_{k=0..n^2} c(n,k) where c(n,k) is the minimum possible
"complexity" (number of distinct rows and columns) among n×n binary matrices
with exactly k ones.

This solver is self-contained (standard library only).

    Return |S3|, the number of k in [0..n^2] for which there exists an n×n
    matrix with exactly k ones and complexity <= 3.

    Key fact used:
      Every complexity <= 3 matrix can be permuted into a 3×3 block "blow-up"
      of a 3×3 binary template that has at most 3 distinct row/column patterns.
      Up to permutations of the 3 groups and complementing (k -> n^2-k),
      all such templates fall into 7 orbits, which yield 7 canonical quadratic
      forms in the group sizes.

    We mark all attainable k via those 7 forms and use complement symmetry by
    mapping k -> min(k, n^2-k) into [0..floor(n^2/2)].
