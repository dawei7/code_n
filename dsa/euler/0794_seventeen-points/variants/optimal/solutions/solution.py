Project Euler 794 — Seventeen Points

At step n we have chosen x1..xn in [0,1) so that each interval [k/n,(k+1)/n) contains
exactly one of these n points.

Key observation
---------------
For a fixed n, "one point per interval" means that after sorting the first n points,
the k-th smallest point must lie in [k/n,(k+1)/n). Therefore the whole procedure is
determined by *where the new point is inserted* in the sorted order at each step.

For any fixed insertion history, every point accumulates interval constraints from
all later steps. The feasible range for a point is the intersection of those
half-open intervals. To minimize the total sum we take each point as small as
possible, i.e. at the maximum of its lower bounds.

We depth-first search all feasible insertion histories up to n=18 (small enough),
track the minimal sum at n=17, and also confirm that no history reaches n=18
(as stated in the problem).

All arithmetic is exact:
every boundary k/n is represented as an integer scaled by D = lcm(1..max_n).

Running this file prints F(17) rounded to 12 decimal places.
